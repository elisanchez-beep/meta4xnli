Well,	O
I	O
wasn't	O
even	O
thinking	O
about	O
that,	O
but	O
I	O
was	O
so	O
frustrated,	O
and,	O
I	O
ended	O
up	O
talking	O
to	O
him	O
again.	O

And	O
I	O
thought	O
that	O
was	O
a	O
privilege,	O
and	O
it's	O
still,	O
it's	O
still,	O
I	O
was	O
the	O
only	O
nine	O
two-two	O
Ex-O	O
which	O
was	O
my	O
AFFC	O
Air	O
Force	O
Career	O
field.	B-METAPHOR

They	O
told	O
me	O
that,	O
uh,	O
that	O
I	O
would	O
be	O
called	O
in	O
a	O
guy	O
at	O
the	O
end	O
for	O
me	O
to	O
meet.	O

There's	O
so	O
much	O
you	O
could	O
talk	O
about	O
on	O
that	O
I'll	O
just	O
skip	B-METAPHOR
that.	O

That	O
was	O
the	O
primary	O
thing	O
we	O
wanted	O
to	O
save	O
since	O
there	O
wasn't	O
any	O
way	B-METAPHOR
to	O
dump	O
a	O
20-megaton	O
H-bomb	O
off	O
a	O
30,	O
a	O
C124.	O

So	O
I'm	O
not	O
really	O
sure	O
why.	O

This	O
is	O
Fannie	O
Flono,	O
and	O
she	O
grew	O
up	O
in	O
Ag--	O
Augusta,	O
GA,	O
and	O
she	O
is	O
going	O
to	O
talk	O
about	O
some	O
stories	O
from	O
her	O
childhood.	O

And	O
I	O
had	O
put	O
uh,	O
five	O
detachments	O
out	O
of	O
U2's.	O

I	O
was	O
the	O
only	O
one	O
that	O
uh,	O
ever	O
run	B-METAPHOR
the	O
regulators	O
for	O
the,	O
the	O
test	O
in	O
the	O
miniature	O
altitude	O
chambers.	O

I'm	O
uh,	O
Chief	O
Master	O
Sergeant,	O
retired,	O
as	O
Rick	O
said.	O

There's	O
some	O
cash	O
flow	B-METAPHOR
projections	O
on	O
my	O
desk	O
and,	O
um,	O
uh,	O
it's	O
for	O
such	O
and	O
such	O
Cutty,	O
that's	O
the	O
client's	O
name.	O

The	O
girl	O
that	O
can	O
help	B-METAPHOR
me	O
is	O
all	O
the	O
way	O
across	O
town.	O

But	O
they	O
were	O
divided	O
about	O
like	O
who	O
were	O
the	O
field	O
hands	O
and	O
who	O
were	O
the	O
house	O
kids,	O
it	O
was	O
kind	O
of--	O

Today	O
he	O
is	O
going	O
to	O
talk	O
to	O
us	O
about	O
the	O
Third	O
SS,	O
the	O
U2	O
Quick	O
and	O
the	O
Blackbird.	O

I	O
mean	O
they	O
only	O
had,	O
like,	O
they	O
had	O
five	O
children,	O
one	O
of	O
them	O
died.	O

And,	O
of	O
course,	O
Androv	O
Gromikov	O
didn't	O
answer	O
anything,	O
but	O
we	O
had	O
all	O
the	O
information	O
from	O
the	O
films	O
the	O
U2	O
had	O
taken.	O

She	O
said	O
there	O
were	O
just	O
tears	O
coming	O
down	O
from	O
her	O
eyes	O
and	O
she	O
said,	O
then	O
she	O
said	O
Joe	O
came	O
up	O
on	O
the	O
porch.	O

Even	O
if	O
the	O
aircraft	O
was	O
on	O
fire,	O
why	O
it,	O
it	O
would	O
uh,	O
burn	O
and	O
it	O
would	O
melt	O
through	O
a	O
lead	O
component	O
for	O
the	O
radiation	O
to	O
leak	O
out.	O

This	O
is	O
Chief	O
Master	O
Sergeant	O
Clem	O
Francis,	O
retired	O
from	O
the	O
US	O
Air	O
Force.	O

Well	O
it	O
got	O
to	O
where	O
there's	O
two	O
or	O
three	O
aircraft	O
arrive	O
in	O
a	O
week	O
and	O
I	O
didn't	O
know	O
where	O
they're	O
flying	O
to.	O

They	O
had	O
already	O
had	O
their	O
training	O
in	O
the	O
full	O
pressure	O
suits	O
and	O
it	O
taken	O
me	O
a	O
while	O
if	O
you	O
go	O
into	O
full	O
pressure	O
suits.	O

I	O
want	O
to	O
say	O
that	O
there	O
wasn't	O
any	O
danger	O
of	O
going	O
in	O
with	O
the	O
bomb	O
because	O
it	O
would	O
not	O
explode,	O
regardless	O
of	O
how	O
hard	O
it	O
hit	O
the	O
ground.	O

And	O
how	O
about	O
it	O
looks	O
like	O
exactly	O
what	O
I'm	O
trying	O
to	O
do.	O

But	O
anyway,	O
the	O
animals	O
would	O
get	O
loose	O
all	O
the	O
time,	O
especially	O
the	O
goats.	O

The	O
doors	O
were	O
locked	O
when	O
we	O
went	O
in.	O

So	O
I	O
just	O
had	O
to	O
take	O
the	O
totals	O
and	O
try	O
and	O
figure	O
it	O
like	O
that.	O

He	O
came,	O
he	O
opened	O
the	O
door	O
and	O
I	O
remember	O
looking	O
back	O
and	O
seeing	O
the	O
expression	O
on	O
his	O
face,	O
and	O
I	O
could	O
tell	O
that	O
he	O
was	O
disappointed.	O

So,	O
I	O
don't	O
have	O
any	O
specific	O
stories.	O

And	O
it	O
was,	O
he	O
never	O
really	O
had	O
to	O
do	O
anything	O
for	O
himself.	O

So	O
I'm	O
like,	O
Oh	O
my	O
gosh,	O
and	O
Ramona	O
was	O
standing	O
there.	O

And	O
the	O
fact	O
is	O
she	O
was	O
light!	O

I	O
don't	O
know	O
whether	O
he	O
stayed	O
in	O
Augusta	O
after	O
that.	O

All	O
we	O
done,	O
they	O
never	O
did	O
tell	O
us	O
any	O
place	O
where	O
they	O
was	O
going,	O
even	O
when	O
they	O
left	O
the	O
base	O
to	O
go	O
to	O
somewhere	O
else	O
to	O
stay	O
for	O
a	O
while.	O

They	O
said,	O
We're	O
paying	O
for	O
a	O
place	O
for	O
you	O
to	O
stay.	O

Well,	O
the	O
next	O
day,	O
of	O
course,	O
President	O
Kennedy,	O
uh,	O
blockaded	O
Cuba,	O
and,	O
uh,	O
our	O
ships	O
stopped	O
a	O
Russian	O
ship	O
that	O
was	O
headed	O
just	O
outside	O
of	O
Cuba	O
within,	O
and	O
they	O
found	O
missiles	O
on	O
them.	O

Anyhow	O
the	O
man	O
comes	O
in.	O

Um,	O
my	O
grandparents	O
were	O
always	O
very,	O
very	O
loving	O
people	O
and	O
some	O
of,	O
my	O
parents	O
were	O
and	O
we'd	O
just	O
have	O
a	O
great	O
time	O
down	O
there.	O

I	O
didn't	O
have	O
time	O
to	O
enter	O
in	O
all	O
kinds	O
of	O
whatever.	O

And,	O
uh,	O
one	O
of	O
my	O
jobs	O
at	O
the	O
time	O
was	O
training	O
individuals	O
how	O
to	O
put	O
parachutes	O
on	O
a	O
nuclear	O
weapons	O
trigger	O
to,	O
uh,	O
which	O
detonates	O
the	O
atomic	O
bomb	O
itself.	O

My	O
grandmother	O
used	O
to	O
tell	O
me	O
a	O
lot	O
of	O
different	O
stories	B-METAPHOR
about	O
her	O
growing-up	O
years	O
and,	O
uh,	O
especially,	O
uh,	O
she	O
used	O
to	O
talk	O
about	O
her	O
family,	O
and	O
what	O
it	O
was	O
like	O
during	O
those	O
times.	O

We	O
had	O
full	O
pressure	O
suits	O
there	O
in	O
the	O
aircraft	O
just,	O
just	O
like	O
the	O
astronauts	O
wore,	O
except	O
ours	O
was	O
totally	O
silver,	O
silver	O
uh,	O
boot	O
and	O
everything,	O
to	O
reflect	B-METAPHOR
heat,	O
of	O
course.	O

And	O
he	O
was,	O
my	O
grandfather	O
was	O
not	O
a	O
nice	O
man.	O

It's	O
30	O
or	O
40	O
U2	O
aircraft,	O
and	O
we'd	O
started	O
the	O
training	O
Chinese	O
pilots,	O
British	O
pilots	O
in	O
them,	O
just	O
all	O
over	O
the,	O
the	O
world	O
that	O
we	O
were	O
allies	O
with.	O

So,	O
she's	O
like,	O
Well	O
look,	O
look	O
up	O
this	O
in	O
such	O
and	O
such	O
company.	O

He	O
said	O
that	O
they	O
had	O
gone	O
up	O
North.	O

Um,	O
no,	O
to	O
be	O
honest,	O
I	O
never	O
read	O
any	O
of	O
the	O
books	O
I	O
was	O
supposed	O
to.	O

I	O
go	O
ahead	O
and	O
picked	O
the	O
baggage	O
and	O
went	O
to	O
the	O
address	O
I	O
was	O
supposed	O
to.	O

It	O
was	O
an	O
amazing	O
mood	O
swing.	B-METAPHOR

They've,	O
they	O
chosen	O
me	O
over	O
about	O
15	O
individuals	O
there,	O
to	O
go	O
to	O
through	O
that	O
school	O
and	O
I'm	O
not,	O
I'm	O
not.	O

They	O
have	O
to	O
go	O
through	O
a	O
number	O
of	O
altitude	O
chambers,	O
uh,	O
rides	O
before	O
they	O
start	O
even	O
flying	O
U2's	O
or	O
flying	O
with	O
pressure	O
suits.	O

I'm	O
covering	B-METAPHOR
the	O
same	O
stuff.	O

This	O
was	O
the	O
first	O
time	O
that,	O
that	O
had	O
happened	O
in	O
75	O
years,	O
that	O
TX	O
legislature	O
had	O
voted	O
a	O
military	O
unit	O
being	O
TX	O
Ambassadors,	O
so,	O
needed	O
TX	O
Ambassadors.	O

If	O
there	O
was	O
anything	O
I	O
could	O
do.	O

She	O
hated	O
that,	O
and	O
she	O
used	O
to	O
tell	O
her	O
sister	O
every	O
day,	O
she	O
said	O
that,	O
that	O
You	O
are	O
doing	O
wrong.	O

So	O
I	O
went	O
to	O
her	O
house	O
and	O
then	O
I	O
called	O
in	O
to	O
this	O
number	O
I	O
was	O
supposed	O
to	O
call	O
when	O
I	O
got	O
there.	O

Well	O
I	O
get	O
there	O
this	O
morning	O
and	O
um,	O
I	O
forget	O
how,	O
I	O
think	O
either	O
I	O
asked	O
a	O
question	O
and	O
he	O
came	O
in	O
there	O
or,	O
whatever.	O

We	O
didn't	O
know	O
where	O
they	O
were	O
going.	O

But	O
I	O
was	O
like,	O
forget	O
it,	O
I'm	O
going	O
to	O
eat	O
lunch	O
I	O
was	O
hungry.	O

So	O
and	O
let	O
me	O
tell	O
you	O
I	O
got	O
to	O
the	O
point	O
today	O
where	O
I	O
was	O
about	O
to	O
quit.	O

He	O
was	O
born	O
in	O
1880	O
something,	O
like	O
188,	O
I	O
think	O
it	O
was	O
1889,	O
I	O
think	O
it	O
was	O
when	O
he	O
was	O
born.	O

You'd	O
better	O
get	O
the	O
little	O
screw	O
turned	O
down	O
a	O
little	O
bit	O
because	O
you	O
could	O
damage	O
and	O
individual's	O
lungs	O
very	O
easily.	O

I	O
got	O
orders	O
to	O
go	O
to	O
Del	O
Rio,	O
TX,	O
so	O
when	O
I	O
arrived	O
out	O
there,	O
well,	O
I	O
found	O
out	O
I	O
had	O
to	O
go	O
to	O
Laughlin	O
Air	O
Force	O
Base.	O

Everybody	O
gets	O
champagne	O
and	O
some	O
people	O
don't	O
drink	O
it	O
so	O
what's	O
left	O
the	O
kids	O
drink	O
so	O
we	O
were	O
going	O
around	O
drinking	O
all	O
this	O
champagne.	O

There	O
are	O
many	O
stories	O
in	O
the	O
naked	B-METAPHOR
city.	O

You	O
live	O
and	O
learn,	O
you	O
know,	O
when	O
you	O
test,	O
uh,	O
aircraft.	O

I	O
mean	O
that	O
was	O
the	O
whole	O
point.	O

It	O
was	O
from	O
a	O
airbase	O
that	O
flew	O
over	O
Cuba,	O
and	O
of	O
course	O
Rudolph	O
Anderson	O
was	O
shot	O
down.	O

It	O
was	O
probably	O
the	O
first	O
thing	O
I	O
remember	O
from	O
being	O
a	O
little	O
kid	O
about,	O
ah,	O
especially	O
about	O
something	O
that	O
I'd	O
done	O
wrong.	O

They	O
just	O
didn't	O
like	O
what	O
it	O
was	O
like	O
being	O
black	O
in	O
those	O
days,	O
and	O
that	O
was,	O
you	O
know,	O
I	O
guess,	O
that,	O
that	O
was	O
probably,	O
you	O
know,	O
in	O
the	O
early	O
1930s,	O
uh,	O
when	O
they	O
did	O
that.	O

Nobody	O
knew	O
where	O
they	O
went.	O

And	O
they	O
couldn't	O
stay	O
in	O
the	O
Augusta	O
area	O
because	O
people	O
knew	O
that	O
they	O
had	O
tried	O
to	O
do	O
something	O
that	O
was	O
really	O
taboo	O
and	O
try	O
to	O
pass	O
for	O
white.	O

Yeah,	O
well,	O
the	O
guy's	O
here.	O

We	O
were	O
watching	O
something	O
on	O
TV.	O

So	O
anyhow,	O
I	O
think	O
I	O
spoke	O
to	O
Ramona	O
again.	O

He	O
was	O
the	O
only	O
casualty	O
of	O
the	O
Cuban	O
Crisis,	O
and	O
uh,	O
Kaiser	O
uh,	O
he	O
got	O
the	O
pictures	O
and	O
flew	O
straight	O
to	O
Andrews	O
Air	O
Force	O
in	O
Washington.	O

Um,	O
and	O
she	O
said,	O
she	O
said,	O
she	O
said,	O
Baby,	O
she	O
said,	O
You	O
don't	O
understand	O
about	O
life	O
the	O
way	B-METAPHOR
I	O
understand	O
about	O
life.	O

Then	O
I	O
get	O
it	O
and	O
I'm	O
like	O
great,	O
What	O
do	O
I	O
do	O
with	O
it?	O

Just	O
give	O
me	O
a	O
minute	O
if	O
you	O
want	O
to	O
cut	O
it	O
off,	O
I'd,	O
uh,	O
go.	O

So	O
I	O
went	O
to,	O
I	O
went	O
to	O
Washington	O
D.C.	O
and	O
I	O
didn't	O
go	O
directly	O
to,	O
uh,	O
that,	O
uh,	O
they	O
had	O
told	O
me	O
to	O
on	O
my	O
orders.	O

She	O
was	O
a	O
light-skinned	O
black	O
person.	O

So	O
anyway,	O
Dad	O
goes	O
and	O
makes	O
this	O
nice	O
big	O
glass	O
of	O
chocolate	O
milk	O
for	O
me.	O

The	O
DOT	O
had	O
to	O
buy	O
the	O
property	O
and	O
stuff.	O

He	O
would	O
have	O
been	O
born	O

I'm	O
like,	O
I	O
know	O
how	O
far	B-METAPHOR
I've	O
gotten.	O

OK,	O
can	O
you	O
hear	O
me?	O

Um,	O
are	O
there	O
any,	O
you	O
said	O
you	O
don't	O
remember	O
reading	O
anything	O
in	O
particular,	O
like	O
when	O
you	O
were	O
older	O
in	O
school,	O
were	O
there	O
any	O
books	O
that	O
you	O
read	O
that	O
you	O
liked	O
or	O
hated?	O

It's	O
a	O
little	O
screw	O
which	O
set	O
an	O
injection	O
but	O
the,	O
the	O
breathing	O
pressure	O
tube	O
to	O
the	O
pilot	O
and	O
counter	O
pressure.	O

She's	O
like,	O
Don't	O
worry	O
about	O
it,	O
you	O
know,	O
just	O
take	O
your	O
time.	O

President	O
Kennedy	O
says	O
to	O
the	O
pilots,	O
says,	O
Gentlemen	O
you	O
take	O
good	O
pictures.	O

And	O
I	O
was	O
like,	O
I'm	O
almost	O
done.	O

I	O
tried	O
to	O
jot	O
everything	O
down.	O

No,	O
she	O
was	O
born	O
in	O
1900	O
because	O
she	O
was	O
16,	O
and	O
so	O
it	O
must	O
have	O
been	O
like	O
in	O
1926,	O
19,	O
you	O
know,	O
before,	O
before	O
1930.	O

So	O
it	O
was	O
just	O
really	O
interesting.	O

Her	O
sister	O
could	O
pass	O
for	O
white,	O
and	O
in	O
fact	O
did	O
pass	O
for	O
white.	O

Well,	O
he	O
was	O
almost,	O
old	O
enough	O
to	O
be	O
her	O
daddy.	O

That,	O
I	O
was	O
the	O
only	O
922	O
which	O
was	O
life	O
support	O
man	O
the	O
other	O
man	O
was	O
a	O
physiological	O
support.	B-METAPHOR

And	O
here	O
I	O
am	O
thinking	O
he's	O
going	O
come	O
in	O
there	O
and	O
be	O
like,	O
you	O
know,	O
just	O
have	O
it	O
out	O
with	O
me,	O
you	O
know,	O
just	O
tell	O
me	O
off	O
like	O
how	O
could	O
I	O
not	O
have	O
this	O
done.	O

Well	O
of,	O
of	O
course,	O
needless	O
to	O
say,	O
we	O
had	O
a,	O
we	O
could	O
not	O
make	O
a	O
mistake.	O

And,	O
uh,	O
but,	O
uh,	O
I	O
would	O
think,	O
at	O
night	O
I	O
couldn't	O
sleep.	O

One	O
thing	O
that	O
she	O
really	O
had	O
as	O
a	O
great	O
defense.	B-METAPHOR

Um,	O
as	O
far	O
as	O
never	O
being	O
told--	O

So	O
he,	O
we	O
lived	O
in	O
this	O
area.	O

And	O
he's	O
like	O
talking	O
all	O
fast;	O
he's	O
on	O
a	O
cell	O
phone.	O

I	O
can't	O
remember	O
what	O
it	O
was	O
but	O
I	O
suddenly	O
got	O
really	O
nervous	O
that	O
I	O
was	O
about	O
to	O
go	O
to	O
school	O
for	O
the	O
first	O
time	O
and	O
that	O
was	O
probably	O
the	O
most	O
stressful	O
day	O
of	O
my	O
life.	O

I	O
was	O
living,	O
uh,	O
right	O
outside	O
of	O
St.	O
Louis,	O
between	O
Jefferson	O
City	O
and	O
St.	O
Louis,	O
MO.	O

I	O
was	O
reporting	O
to	O
a	O
certain	O
place	O
in	O
Del	O
Rio,	O
then	O
I	O
had	O
to	O
go	O
to	O
Laughlin	O
Air	O
Force	O
Base,	O
which	O
had	O
just	O
re-opened.	O

I	O
don't	O
care	O
how	O
you	O
do	O
it.	O

So	O
then	O
I	O
look	O
up,	O
I	O
find	O
out	O
where	O
Ramona's	O
at,	O
and	O
I	O
call	O
her	O
over	O
there.	O

In	O
the	O
meantime	O
the	O
Air	O
Force	O
bought	O
the	O
SR71,	O
now	O
the	O
A-12,	O
that	O
we	O
were	O
working	O
with	O
the	O
CIA.	O

So	O
her	O
sister's	O
husband	O
was	O
light-skinned	O
too?	O

But	O
as	O
she	O
got	O
older,	O
um,	O
she	O
never	O
acknowledged	O
that	O
she	O
was	O
wrong	O
but	O
she	O
did	O
change	O
her	O
behavior.	O

My	O
uncle,	O
he's	O
a	O
great	O
guy.	O

I	O
went	O
to	O
my	O
sister's	O
that	O
lived	O
there	O
.	O
Her	O
husband	O
was	O
in	O
the	O
service	O
and	O
worked	O
with	O
Intelligence,	O
and	O
I	O
went	O
to	O
their	O
house.	O

I	O
would	O
think,	O
Well,	O
I'm,	O
I'm	O
going	O
to	O
let	O
somebody	O
else	O
go,	O
but	O
then	O
I	O
would	O
think,	O
My	O
God!	O

One	O
minute	O
he's	O
banging	O
on	O
the	O
desk,	O
the	O
next	O
he's	O
OK,	O
have	O
it	O
on	O
my	O
desk,	O
dah,	O
dah,	O
dah,	O
dah,	O
dah.	O

So	O
anyway,	O
um,	O
he	O
ended	O
up	O
coming	O
in	O
there	O
and	O
he	O
was	O
like,	O
How's	O
it	O
coming	O
along?	O

Then	O
I	O
was	O
spinning	O
my	O
wheel	O
for	O
about,	O
I	O
don't	O
know,	O
it	O
seemed	O
like	O
all	O
day	O
that	O
day.	O

And	O
she	O
had	O
tuberculosis	O
and	O
I	O
never	O
knew	O
that	O
either.	O

You	O
know,	O
you	O
can't,	O
you	O
cannot	O
survive	O
if	O
you	O
don't	O
have	O
any	O
counter	O
pressure,	O
increase	O
breathing	O
pressure	O
in	O
those	O
altitudes.	O

I	O
started	O
immediately,	O
uh,	O
uh,	O
training	O
into	O
that	O
from	O
the	O
other	O
two	O
guys	O
that	O
was	O
at	O
the	O
location.	O

If	O
it	O
was	O
off	O
one	O
iota,	O
you	O
had	O
to	O
do	O
some	O
adjusting	O
to	O
the	O
regulator	O
itself.	O

Uh,	O
I	O
was	O
still	O
the	O
one	O
and	O
only	O
nine	O
two-two	O
that	O
had	O
ever	O
set	O
the	O
injection	O
on	O
the	O
regulator.	O

She	O
didn't	O
even	O
understand	O
the	O
marriage	O
ceremony,	O
she	O
didn't	O
even	O
know	O
that	O
she	O
had	O
gotten	O
married,	O
really--	O

We	O
would	O
go	O
in	O
there.	O

And	O
it	O
was	O
like	O
she	O
was	O
rejecting	O
who	O
she	O
was,	O
in	O
some	O
ways,	B-METAPHOR
by,	O
you	O
know,	O
the	O
way	B-METAPHOR
she	O
treated	O
you	O
know,	O
the	O
other	O
grandchildren.	O

It	O
was	O
really	O
cool,	O
and	O
the	O
dress	O
kind	O
of	O
blew	O
in	O
the	O
wind	O
a	O
little	O
bit--	O

Uh,	O
I	O
spent	B-METAPHOR
much	O
of	O
my	O
time	O
in,	O
uh,	O
Special	O
Activities.	O

And	O
I	O
asked	O
him,	O
you	O
know,	O
could	O
I	O
do	O
it,	O
um,	O
Do	O
you	O
need	O
me	O
to	O
stay	O
and	O
do	O
it	O
tonight	O
or	O
I	O
could	O
have	O
it	O
done	O
by	O
lunchtime	O
tomorrow,	O
if	O
that's	O
OK.	O

But	O
uh,	O
they	O
lived	O
in	O
a	O
little	O
country	O
town	O
outside	O
of	O
Augusta	O
called	O
Evans,	O
and	O
Evans	O
still	O
exists,	O
and	O
that's	O
where	O
a	O
lot	O
of	O
my	O
relatives	O
still,	O
still	O
are	O
too.	O

My	O
sister	O
keeps	O
telling	O
me,	O
she	O
says,	O
Sometimes	O
you're	O
just	O
like	O
Granny,	O
you	O
treat	O
people	O
wrong	O
for	O
the	O
wrong	O
reasons.	O

Um,	O
then	O
we	O
moved	O
to	O
a	O
new	O
house.	O

I	O
was	O
like,	O
OK,	O
well	O
that's	O
good,	O
you	O
know,	O
like	O
that.	O

And	O
the	O
spots	O
of	O
paint	O
would	O
change	O
every	O
hundred	O
degrees,	O
it	O
might	O
be	O
red,	O
it	O
change	O
to	O
blue.	O

I	O
ate	O
real	O
quick,	O
as	O
fast	O
as	O
I	O
could	O
and	O
then	O
she	O
came	O
in	O
there	O
and	O
she	O
ended	O
up	O
helping	O
me	O
with	O
it.	O

Her	O
sister's	O
husband	O
was	O
light-skinned	O
too.	O

Anyway,	O
they	O
come	O
up	O
with	O
this	O
invention	O
of	O
the	O
high	O
O2	O
regulator.	O

And	O
so,	O
we	O
moved	O
to	O
Las	O
Vegas,	O
NV,	O
and	O
I	O
reported,	O
just	O
like	O
I	O
did	O
in	O
Washington,	O
to	O
a	O
certain	O
address	O
in	O
downtown	O
Las	O
Vegas.	O

Ah,	O
fourth	O
grade	O
was	O
a	O
lot	O
of	O
fun.	O

It's	O
like	O
one	O
file	O
with	O
a	O
whole	O
bunch	O
of	O
tabs,	O
of	O
different,	O
you	O
know,	O
each	O
tab	O
has	O
like	O
a	O
different	O
spreadsheet	O
on	O
it.	O

I	O
don't	O
care	O
how	O
you	O
get	O
it	O
done.	O

And	O
they	O
moved	O
to	O
Mallard	O
Creek	O
in	O
Charlotte.	O

Where	O
he	O
was	O
a	O
,	O
he	O
was	O
a	O
minister's	O
son,	O
so	O
he	O
had,	O
they	O
had	O
property,	O
and	O
stuff,	O
and	O
they	O
were	O
very	O
well-connected	B-METAPHOR
in	O
the	O
community	O
and	O
very,	O
held	O
in	O
high	B-METAPHOR
esteem.	O

And	O
I	O
um,	O
I	O
didn't	O
know	O
how	O
much	O
detail	O
he	O
wanted.	O

And	O
um,	O
it's	O
different,	O
like	O
under	O
each	O
client,	O
is	O
all	O
their	O
files.	O

It's	O
like	O
more	O
simplified,	O
like	O
the	O
one	O
that	O
she	O
had	O
given	O
me	O
was	O
all	O
detailed	O
and	O
complicated	O
and	O
the	O
second	O
one	O
is	O
all	O
simple.	O

Cause	O
they	O
didn't	O
actually	O
live	O
in	O
Augusta,	O
they	O
lived	O
in,	O
well	O
you	O
know,	O
Augusta	O
was	O
still	O
a	O
city-town	O
during	O
that	O
time,	O
even	O
though	O
to	O
people	O
in	O
big	O
cities	O
like	O
this	O
Augusta	O
isn't	O
that	O
big.	O

Late	O
1962,	O
uh,	O
I	O
got	O
orders	O
to	O
go	O
to	O
Washington,	O
D.C.	O

When	O
DOT	O
took	O
his	O
property,	O
we	O
moved	O
to	O
a	O
smaller,	O
smaller	O
area	O
in	O
Concord	O
where	O
you	O
are	O
not	O
allowed	O
to	O
have	O
animals	O
because	O
it's	O
zoned	O
and	O
so	O
that's	O
the	O
end	O
of	O
the	O
animal	O
story.	O

Anyway,	O
we	O
deployed	B-METAPHOR
and	O
I	O
can	O
tell	O
now	O
be,	O
because	O
of	O
this	O
that,	O
that,	O
that,	O
uh,	O
we	O
deployed	B-METAPHOR
to	O
Kadina,	O
Okinawa,	O
and	O
this	O
was	O
in	O
1968.	O

He	O
told	O
me	O
what	O
exactly	O
he	O
needed	O
and	O
that	O
he	O
did	O
need	O
it	O
by	O
today.	O

She	O
had	O
gone	O
already	O
and	O
she	O
told	O
me	O
just	O
don't	O
worry	O
about	O
it.	O

This	O
is	O
just,	O
you	O
know,	O
Look	O
you're	O
in	O
trouble.	O

My,	O
my	O
mother	O
wound	O
up	O
not	O
being	O
one	O
of	O
his	O
favorites	O
early	O
on	O
and,	O
ah,	O
so	O
she	O
was	O
relegated	O
to	O
working	O
in	O
the	O
fields	B-METAPHOR
whereas	O
some	O
of	O
the	O
other	O
kids	O
didn't	O
work	O
in	O
the	O
fields.	B-METAPHOR

And	O
so	O
you	O
know,	O
eventually,	O
you	O
know,	O
you	O
know,	O
they	O
kept	O
asking	O
people	O
around,	O
and	O
nobody	O
knew	O
where	O
they	O
were,	O
and	O
eventually,	O
you	O
know,	O
they	O
just	O
reconciled	O
themselves	O
that	O
they	O
just	O
wouldn't	O
see	O
Joe	O
again.	O

I	O
told	O
them	O
my	O
sister's.	O

And	O
she	O
said	O
then	O
her	O
mama,	O
her	O
mama	O
leaned	O
forward,	O
and	O
she	O
looked	O
and	O
she	O
said,	O
Walks	O
like	O
him.	O

you	O
know,	O
and	O
she's	O
stuffing	O
the	O
petals	O
up	O
there	O
and	O
I	O
didn't	O
really	O
know	O
of	O
any	O
consequences.	O

Ah,	O
another	O
thing	O
that	O
happened	O
there	O
that	O
I	O
thought	O
was	O
interesting	O
was	O
one	O
of	O
the	O
first	O
memories	O
of	O
my	O
sister,	O
and	O
that	O
was	O
in	O
that	O
very	O
same	O
backyard.	O

So	O
all	O
that	O
stressing	O
and	O
I	O
mean,	O
I	O
had	O
every	O
reason	O
to	O
stress	O
today,	O
it	O
was	O
like,	O
you're	O
giving	O
something	O
you	O
don't	O
know	O
how	O
to	O
do,	O
and	O
it's	O
like	O
here	O
do	O
it.	O

So	O
now,	O
here	O
it	O
is,	O
he	O
wants	O
it	O
today.	O

And	O
unfortunately	O
we	O
moved	O
again.	O

I	O
didn't	O
really	O
know	O
Mrs.	O
Faulk	O
very	O
well	O
she	O
was	O
about	O
80	O
and,	O
ah,	O
she	O
was	O
a	O
nice	O
person	O
I	O
had	O
seen	O
her	O
a	O
few	O
times	O
but	O
I	O
was	O
really	O
nervous	O
about	O
that.	O

We	O
lived	O
off,	O
um,	O
85	O
in	O
Mallard	O
Creek	O
where	O
currently	O
the	O
485	O
is	O
now	O
cause	O
then	O
the	O
like	O
last	O
ten	O
years	O
we	O
had	O
to	O
move	O
because	O
of	O
the	O
485.	O

Boss,	O
he	O
was	O
like	O
with	O
split	B-METAPHOR
personality	O
man.	O

He's	O
old	O
enough	O
to	O
be	O
my	O
daddy.	O

Everything	O
is	O
linked,	B-METAPHOR
and	O
gosh,	O
I	O
don't	O
even	O
know	O
how	O
long.	O

This	O
time	O
I	O
wasn't	O
even	O
happy	O
that	O
she	O
was	O
there	O
because	O
I	O
was	O
so	O
stressed	O
out.	O

and	O
that's	O
a	O
lot	O
of	O
it	O
is	O
due	O
to	O
the	O
fact	O
that	O
the	O
mothers	O
are	O
on	O
drugs	O

yeah	O
it's	O
real	O
nice	O
has	O
it	O
been	O
raining	O

oh	O
what	O
human	O
life	O
is	O
worth	O
and	O
whether	O
or	O
not	O
you	O
can	O
rehabilitate	O
somebody	O

oh	O
boy	O

lot	O
of	O
fun	O
yeah	O
it's	O
amazing	O
to	O
me	O
how	O
how	O
many	O
things	O

exactly	O
i	O

by	O
the	O
time	O
you	O

think	O

yeah	O
she	O
was	O
great	O
you	O
know	O
she	O

yeah	O
he	O
suggested	O
just	O
getting	O
uh	O
um	O
a	O
uh	O
um	O
a	O
mop	O
like	O
you	O
would	O
use	O

its	O
really	O
bad	O
out	O
here	O
we	O
just	O
had	O
a	O
freeway	O
shooting	O
about	O
three	O
blocks	O
from	O
our	O
house	O

uh-huh	O
that's	O
true	O
it	O
is	O
it's	O
not	O
really	O
uh	O
consistent	O

i'm	O
trying	O
to	O
hang	B-METAPHOR
in	O
there	O

yes	O
oh	O
what	O
sort	O
of	O
puppy	O
do	O
you	O
have	O

well	O
you	O
said	O
you	O
have	O
kids	O
how	O
old	O

they	O
probably	O
weren't	O
the	O
most	O
brilliant	B-METAPHOR
people	O
in	O
the	O
world	O
but	O
they	O
uh	O
were	O
very	O
personable	O
and	O
took	O
uh	O
a	O
interest	O
in	O
people	O
who	O
were	O
willing	O
to	O
study	O

one	O
time	O
we	O
did	O
go	O
that	O
thing	O
uh	O
there	O
we	O
came	O
back	O
from	O
an	O
event	O
and	O
turned	O
the	O
lights	O
on	O
around	O
the	O
camp	O
site	O
and	O
there's	O
a	O
skunk	O
right	O

you	O
know	O
all	O
my	O
children	O
excel	O
they're	O
they're	O
really	O
good	O
and	O
i	O
guess	O
no	O
he	O
learns	O
from	O
the	O
older	O
boys	O
too	O
but	O

and	O
it	O
would	O
also	O
cause	O
people	O
to	O
compact	O
their	O
garbage	O
more	O
uh	O
and	O
uh	O
and	O
limiting	O
the	O
volume	O
is	O
probably	O
a	O
little	O
bit	O
closer	B-METAPHOR
to	O
the	O
real	O
problem	O
than	O
limiting	O
the	O
weight	O

so	O
if	O
there's	O
a	O
mistake	O
it's	O
your	O
mistake	O
i	O
guess	O

you	O
know	O
especially	O
making	O
the	O
seams	O
and	O
things	O
like	O
that	O
you	O
know	O
it's	O
it's	O
got	O
such	O
a	O
professional	O
finish	O
on	O
them	O

yeah	O
yeah	O
my	O
place	O
you	O
get	O
two	O
weeks	O
when	O
you	O
start	O
and	O
then	O
every	O
every	O
year	O
they	O
give	O
you	O
an	O
extra	O
day	O
until	O
you've	O
got	O
four	O
weeks	O

uh	O
that's	O
what's	O
nice	O
about	O
living	O
more	O
in	O
the	O
country	O
you	O
don't	O
have	O
to	O
worry	O
about	O
any	O
of	O
that	O

oh	O
oh	O
my	O
word	O
well	O
that	O
sounds	O
adventuresome	B-METAPHOR

and	O
now	O
i	O
have	O
got	O
a	O
sister	O
in	O
Germany	O

i	O
have	O
a	O
younger	O
daughter	O
now	O
and	O
uh	O
i	O
it's	O
kind	O
of	O
hard	B-METAPHOR
to	O
get	O
her	O
get	O
her	O
there	O
and	O
everything	O
but	O
i	O
am	O
going	O
to	O
to	O
uh	O

yeah	O
have	O
a	O
nice	O
summer	O

we're	O
not	O
real	O
naturalists	O
or	O
anything	O
but	O
um	O

yeah	O
i	O
remember	O
my	O
grandparents	O
and	O
i	O
used	O
to	O
always	O
get	O
out	O
there	O
on	O
the	O
road	O
and	O
pick	O
up	O
beer	O
cans	O
and	O
uh	O

so	O
this	O
is	O
this	O
is	O
not	O
your	O
first	O
experience	O
with	O
with	O
a	O
dog	O

right	O

one	O
guy	O
went	O

ex-wife	O
to	O
death	O
because	O
she	O
was	O
sleeping	O
with	O
another	O

all	O
turned	O

down	O
there	O

they	O

it	O
as	O
a	O

so	O
the	O
officer	O

is	O
a	O
good	O
idea	O

so	O
it	O
it	O
looked	O
pretty	O
sharp	B-METAPHOR

and	O
we	O
keep	O
our	O
cans	O
in	O
one	O

have	O
a	O

here	O
and	O
uh	O
it	O
requires	O
a	O

and	O
you	O
have	O
to	O
keep	O
it	O
cut	O
very	O
short	O
if	O
you	O
want	O
it	O
to	O
look	O

him	O

uh	O
whenever	O
you	O
buy	O
an	O
item	O
especially	O
a	O
large	O
purchase	O
item	O
it	O
it's	O
it's	O
something	O
in	O
which	O
you're	O
you're	O
paying	O
and	O
you've	O
always	O
got	O
to	O
add	O
in	O
that	O
about	O
ten	O
percent	O
tax	O

which	O
is	O
a	O
little	O
unusual	O
but	O
its	O
done	O
through	O
the	O
auspices	O

that's	O
what	O
she	O
plans	O
to	O
do	O
so	O
i	O
hope	O
so	O

exactly	O
but	O
i	O
mean	O
with	O
the	O
new	O
laws	O
it's	O
really	O
it's	O
tough	B-METAPHOR
now	O

golly	O
you	O
know	O
he	O
didn't	O
even	O
follow	O
any	O
of	O
the	O
rules	O
and	O
i	O
and	O
didn't	O
even	O
seem	O
to	O
bother	O
of	O
course	O
they	O
kicked	O
him	O
right	O
out	O

yeah	O
it	O
just	O
doesn't	O
seem	O
possible	O
does	O
it	O

it's	O
pretty	O
much	O
going	O
between	O
Washington	O
they're	O
undefeated	O
and	O
uh	O
Buffalo	O
New	O
Orleans	O
and	O
Chicago	O
because	O
Chicago's	O
only	O
lost	O
twice	O
and	O
one	O
of	O
those	O
was	O
to	O
Buffalo	O

uh-huh	O
um	O
yes	O
we	O
do	O
have	O
tax	O
on	O
clothes	O

oh	O
i	O
see	B-METAPHOR
well	O
i	O
like	O
the	O
atmosphere	B-METAPHOR
myself	O

um	O
i	O
have	O
one	O
child	O
a	O
little	O
girl	O
who's	O
eighteen	O
months	O
old	O

the	O
the	O
second	O
one	O
that	O
she	O
has	O
was	O
one	O
of	O
the	O
puppies	O
from	O
the	O
litter	O
and	O
uh	O
the	O
one	O
male	O
that	O
she	O
used	O
had	O
a	O
tooth	O
problem	O

oh	O
is	O
that	O
where	O
you're	O
talking	O
from	O

i	O
honestly	O
i	O
don't	O
know	O
because	O
i	O
haven't	O
had	O
to	O
wear	O
that	O
many	O
dress	O
clothes	O
yet	O
to	O
be	O
honest	O
you	O
know	O

did	O
you	O
go	O
to	O
museums	O
in	O
Europe	O

there	O
you	O
go	O
well	O
does	O
you	O
husband	O
uh	O
what	O
does	O
he	O
think	O
of	O
your	O
uh	O
T-shirt	O
and	O
and	O

um	O
not	O
even	O
cast	O
aluminum	O
they	O
were	O
just	O
pressed	O
aluminum	O

and	O
it	O
still	O
scared	O
me	O

and	O
then	O
the	O
second	O
thing	O
i'd	O
probably	O
look	O
at	O
is	O
uh	O
what	O
they	O
can	O
afford	O

well	O
i	O
don't	O
remember	O
it	O
seemed	O
like	O
it	O
did	O
but	O
it	O
might	O
not	O
i	O
guess	O
i	O
guess	O

with	O
your	O
TV	O
set	O
and	O
you	O
feel	O
that	O
a	O
fitting	B-METAPHOR
punishment	O
for	O
television	O
theft	O
is	O
death	O

the	O
beach	O
was	O
beautiful	O
and	O
and	O
that	O
was	O
really	O
uh	O
a	O
nice	O
place	O
to	O
go	O
so	O
that's	O
that's	O
probably	O
one	O
of	O
my	O
most	O
favorite	O
places	O
to	O
go	O
how	O
about	O
you	O

throw	B-METAPHOR
a	O
Coke	O
ad	O
in	O
there	O

okay	O
well	O
so	O
let	O
me	O
make	O
sure	O
so	O
so	O
you	O
think	O
that	O
uh	O
maybe	O
a	O
five	O
day	O
waiting	O
period	O
for	O
handguns	O
or	O
that	O
stuff	O
would	O
be	O
legitimate	O

yeah	O
when	O
i	O
had	O
a	O
Cocker	O
Spaniel	O
it	O
it	O
was	O
an	O
outdoor	O
dog	O
and	O
uh	O
i	O
think	O
i	O
liked	O
that	O
better	O
uh-huh	O

well	O
supposedly	O
in	O
seven	O
days	O
they're	O
going	O
they're	O
going	O
to	O
look	O
through	O
y	O
our	O
background	B-METAPHOR
and	O
make	O
sure	O
you	O
are	O
not	O
an	O
ex-con	O
or	O
don't	O
have	O

you	O
know	O
i	O
would	O
rather	O
much	O
rather	O
get	O
on	O
a	O
plane	O
and	O
get	O
there	O
and	O
then	O
enjoy	O
myself	O

a	O
few	O
months	O
ago	O
that	O
they	O
had	O
six	O
member	O
juries	O
i	O
thought	O
that	O
they	O
you	O
know	O
it	O
was	O
always	O
twelve	O
twelve	O
men	O
tried	O
and	O
true	O
so	O
to	O
speak	O

all	O
the	O
uh	O
credit	O
union	O
CEOs	O
and	O
people	O
like	O
that	O
so	O
she	O
was	O
really	O
into	O
the	O
keeping	O
up	O
on	O
what's	O
going	O
on	O
with	O
the	O
credit	O
unions	O

i	O
know	O
everybody's	O
i	O
mean	O
everybody's	O
always	O
busy	O
and	O
worried	O
and	O
so	O
many	O
problems	O
people	O
don't	O
just	O
sit	O
down	O
and	O
you	O
know	O
just	O
talk	O
and	O
know	O
everything's	O
going	O
to	O
be	O
okay	O

Brian	O
in	O
Plano	O
Texas	O
how	O
are	O
you	O
doing	O
today	O

so	O
it	O
um-hum	O
well	O
it	O
doesn't	O
bring	B-METAPHOR
anything	O
but	O
chaos	O

yeah	O
that's	O
what	O
i	O
i	O
just	O
did	O
today	O
i	O
got	O
uh	O
Darkman	O
have	O
you	O
seen	O
that	O
uh	O
i	O
haven't	O
i'll	O
guess	O
i'll	O
watch	O
it	O
tonight	O

oh	O
goodness	O
well	O
i	O
was	O
an	O
English	O
major	O
so	O
i	O
like	O
to	O
read	O
period	O

and	O
uh	O
gosh	O
sticks	B-METAPHOR
in	O
my	O
mind	O
he	O
paid	O
eighteen	O
hundred	O
dollars	O
for	O
a	O
parrot	O
and	O
that	O
was	O
just	O
mind	O
boggling	O

and	O
you're	O
the	O
minority	O
and	O
you're	O
stuck	B-METAPHOR
with	O
it	O
but	O
uh	O

it's	O
probably	O
more	O
because	O
i	O
just	O
enjoy	O
the	O
coverage	O
than	O
it	O
is	O
because	O
i	O
don't	O
have	O
time	O
to	O
read	O
the	O
paper	O
you	O
know	O

themselves	O
and	O
i	O
like	O
some	O
of	O
their	O
songs	O
but	O
as	O
as	O
i	O
agree	O
as	O
a	O
general	O
rule	O
i	O
i	O
wouldn't	O
choose	O
rap	O
either	O

satisfaction	O
from	O
what	O
things	O
i've	O
heard	O

you	O
know	O
it's	O
easy	O
to	O
say	O
well	O
we'll	O
build	O
a	O
concrete	O
hole	O
and	O
and	O
nothing'll	O
happen	O
and	O
then	O
they'll	O
say	O
well	O
the	O
only	O
way	B-METAPHOR
to	O
test	O
that	O
is	O
over	O
a	O
long	O
period	O
of	O
time	O
so	O

no	O
not	O
necessarily	O
um	O
it	O
can	O
be	O
in	O
house	O
people	O
who	O
help	O
you	O
handle	O
X	O
amount	O
of	O
dollars	O

and	O
uh	O
he	O
snapped	B-METAPHOR
he	O
snapped	B-METAPHOR
out	O
of	O
it	O
he	O
uh	O
he	O
was	O
probably	O
uh	O
say	O
ninety	O
five	O
percent	O
himself	O

so	O
that's	O
that	O
is	O
a	O
problem	O
what	O
kind	O
of	O
criteria	O
do	O
you	O
look	O
for	O
when	O
you	O
are	O
shopping	O
around	O

been	O
nice	O
talking	O
to	O
you	O

oh	O
i	O
see	B-METAPHOR
oh	O
the	O
state	O
doesn't	O
require	O
it	O
well	O
that's	O
kind	O
of	O
that's	O
rather	O
that's	O
rather	O
unusual	O
isn't	O
it	O

oh	O
yeah	O
well	O
some	O
some	O
places	O
are	O
good	O
about	O
sending	O
them	O
out	O
by	O
UPS	O
or	O
or	O
other	O
ways	B-METAPHOR
but	O

well	O
i	O
don't	O
think	O
he	O
i	O
don't	O
think	O
he	O
wants	O
to	O
do	O
that	O
but	O
he	O
he	O
certainly	O
would	O
be	O
like	O
an	O
elder	O
statesman	O
or	O
whatever	O

when	O
they're	O
passed	O
on	O
or	O
something	O
i	O
didn't	O
quite	O
understand	O
it	O

yeah	O
i	O
have	O
two	O
two	O
boys	O
twelve	O
and	O
sixteen	O

oh	O
God	O
course	O
the	O
name	O
just	O
uh	O
the	O
name	O
just	O
slipped	B-METAPHOR
my	O
mind	O
but	O
it's	O
the	O
Peace	O
of	O
Parliament	O

it's	O
a	O
it's	O
a	O
plastic	O
automatic	O
weapon	O
that	O
fires	O

um	O
they're	O
pretty	O
neat	O
they're	O
kind	O
of	O
a	O
a	O
a	O
blue	O
grass	O
country	O
uh	O
they're	O
real	O
fun	O
i	O
mean	O
they're	O

yeah	O
they	O
get	O
crowded	O
real	O
quick	O
the	O
crowd's	O
a	O
little	O
dressier	O
too	O
more	O
of	O
a	O
yuppie	O
crowd	O

well	O
i	O
have	O
a	O
girlfriend	O
who	O
has	O
a	O
daughter	O
that's	O
a	O
teenager	O
and	O
every	O
year	O
before	O
school	O
starts	O
she	O
has	O
me	O
take	O
her	O
shopping	O
for	O
clothes	O
because	O
they	O
fight	B-METAPHOR
too	O
much	O

you	O
know	O
yeah	O
well	O
i	O
i	O
went	O
to	O
the	O
library	O
yesterday	O
looking	O
around	O
and	O
i	O
found	O
this	O
uh	O
new	O
book	O
by	O
PJ	O
O'Rourke	O
called	O
uh	O
uh	O
Parliament	O
of	O
Horrors	O
and	O
it's	O
about	O
uh	O

it's	O
um	O
about	O
twenty	O
minutes	O

yeah	O
that's	O
true	O
but	O
but	O
uh	O
i	O
think	O
i	O
mean	O
even	O
more	O
than	O
that	O
even	O
i	O
mean	O
if	O
you	O
drop	B-METAPHOR
out	O
in	O
high	O

uh	O
it's	O
amazing	O
it's	O
amazing	O
what	O
you	O
can	O
get	O
out	O
of	O
a	O
little	O

and	O
uh	O
it	O
was	O
just	O
really	O
good	O
i	O
knew	O
it	O
was	O
going	O
to	O
be	O
sad	O
and	O
i	O
knew	O
somebody	O
was	O

way	B-METAPHOR
yeah	O

yeah	O
well	O
i	O
in	O
fact	O
i	O
had	O
older	O
singers	O
so	O
or	O
older	O
older	O
singers	O
older	O
sisters	O

you	O
know	O
it's	O
probably	O
about	O
twenty	O
by	O
i	O
don't	O
know	O
twenty	O
by	O
six	O
something	O
like	O
that	O
and	O
it's	O
amazing	O
what	O
you	O
can	O
you	O
know	O
how	O
many	O
plants	O
you	O
can	O
plant	O
in	O
there	O

uh	O
Dances	O
With	O
Wolves	O
we	O
just	O
saw	O
that	O
kind	O
of	O
late	O
what	O
else	O
have	O
i	O
seen	O
uh	O
Silence	O
of	O
the	O

but	O
it's	O
a	O
it's	O
a	O
type	O
of	O

we	O
live	O
in	O
of	O

aren't	O

either	O
though	O
which	O
makes	O
a	O

i	O
don't	O
know	O
though	O
but	O
i	O
still	O
think	O
like	O
out	O
in	O
the	O
country	B-METAPHOR
when	O
she	O
said	O
that	O
i	O
was	O
like	O
what	O

uh	O
no	O
i	O
never	O
organized	O
one	O
but	O
we're	O
we	O
have	O
one	O
uh	O
we're	O
going	O
to	O
have	O
one	O
on	O

i	O

they've	O
had	O
one	O
the	O

uh-huh	O
yours	O
is	O
a	O
four	O

yeah	O
there	O
you	O
you	O
know	O
usually	O
there's	O
uh	O
i	O
have	O
a	O
a	O

a	O

in	O

it	O
was	O
was	O
a	O

yeah	O
it	O
was	O
um	O
real	O
popular	O
obviously	O
it	O
was	O
about	O
a	O
week	O
after	O
it'd	O
come	O
out	O
i	O
think	O

no	O

at	O
all	O
and	O
uh	O
if	O
you	O
get	O
one	O
of	O
these	O

you	O
know	O
go	O

these	O

and	O
uh	O
i	O

that	O
we	O
are	O

to	O
be	O
uh	O
on	O

with	O
them	O
in	O

where	O
and	O
um	O
there'd	O
be	O

um	O
uh	O

and	O
um	O

and	O

they're	O

then	O
Christmas	O
and	O
a	O
day	O
either	O
side	B-METAPHOR
of	O
it	O

that's	O
right	O
we	O
might	O
come	O
up	O
short	O
next	O
year	O
if	O
we	O
haven't	O
spent	O
everything	O
this	O

and	O
so	O
no	O
matter	O
how	O
foolish	B-METAPHOR
the	O

be	O
sure	O
we	O
get	O
rid	O
of	O
that	O
money	O

right	O
well	O
most	O
most	O
of	O
the	O
time	O
when	O
you	O
see	O
bus	O
uh	O
you	O
know	O
the	O
buses	O
with	O
the	O

that's	O
uh	O
those	O
are	O
carbon	O

and	O
uh	O
carbon	O

and	O
water	O

oh	O
yeah	O
yeah	O
that's	O
a	O
great	O
place	O
to	O
visit	O
that	O
really	O
is	O
yeah	O

yeah	O
i	O
like	O
those	O
movies	O
that	O
you	O
watch	O
time	O
and	O
time	O
again	O

and	O
given	O
given	O
that	O
knowledge	O
and	O
stuff	O
with	O
it	O
and	O
he	O
seems	O
to	O
enjoy	O
it	O

the	O
sense	B-METAPHOR
that	O
the	O
checkbook	O
is	O
just	O
a	O
blank	B-METAPHOR
check	O
you	O
know	O
and	O
it's	O
unlimited	O
funds	O
not	O
that	O
she	O
goes	O
out	O
and	O
spends	O
it	O
unlimitedly	O
but	O
it's	O
almost	O
that	O
attitude	O

oh	O
yeah	O
some	O
people	O
think	O
they're	O
predicting	O
that	O
he'll	O
make	O
a	O
big	O
comeback	B-METAPHOR

and	O
let's	O
see	O
twenty	O
years	O
ago	O
i	O
guess	O
we're	O
were	O
just	O
beginning	O
to	O
get	B-METAPHOR
into	I-METAPHOR
what	O
they	O
were	O
calling	O
the	O
uh	O
the	O
sex	O
revolution	O
where	O
uh	O
after	O
the	O
pill	O
and	O
uh	O
uh	O

probably	O
and	O
they	O
do	O
it	O
for	O
how	O
long	O
you've	O
been	O
a	O
member	O
i	O
think	O
too	O

i	O
don't	O
usually	O
i	O
just	O
pass	O
on	O
any	O
recipe	O
that's	O
got	O
more	O
than	O
five	O
or	O
six	O
steps	B-METAPHOR
to	O
it	O
because	O
i	O
just	O
know	O
i'll	O
never	O
take	O
the	O
time	O
to	O
do	O
it	O

i	O
think	O
just	O
one	O
is	O
all	O
you	O
need	O

yeah	O
i	O
i	O
just	O
um	O
heard	O
of	O
him	O
this	O
year	O
my	O
boyfriend	O
um	O
he	O
uh	O
likes	O
some	O
types	O
of	O
country	O
music	O
and	O
he	O
was	O
listening	O
to	O
that	O
and	O
it	O

well	O
nice	O
talking	O
to	O
you	O
thanks	O
a	O
lot	O
bye	O
bye	O

spend	O
it	O
on	O
the	O
ones	O
who	O
who	O
do	O
have	O
a	O
chance	O

so	O
if	O
we	O
have	O
the	O
opportunity	O
just	O
because	O
it's	O
quieter	O

yeah	O
i'll	O
probably	O
try	O
to	O
go	O
see	O

so	O
i	O
want	O
to	O
keep	O
at	O
it	O
because	O
i	O
know	O
that	O
if	O
you	O
don't	O
uh	O
there's	O
there's	O
lots	O
of	O
problems	O
that	O
you	O
can	O
have	O

and	O
uh	O
so	O
it's	O
a	O
giant	O
plastics	O
plant	O
i	O
think	O
they	O
have	O
a	O
seventy	O
like	O
a	O
seventy	O
five	O
percent	O
market	O
share	O
or	O
something	O

when	O
i	O
was	O
growing	O
up	O
uh	O

they	O
don't	O
have	O
snow	O
they	O
don't	O
know	O
what	O
snow	O
is	O
they	O
freak	O
out	O
when	O
there's	O
snow	O
on	O
the	O
ground	O
oh	O
Amarillo	O
well	O
that's	O
close	O
to	O
here	O
how	O
long	O
have	O
you	O
been	O
in	O
Raleigh	O

well	O
well	O
not	O
not	O
even	O
lately	O
tell	O
me	O

huh-uh	O
uh	O
not	O
downhill	O
we	O
do	O
have	O
cross	O
country	O
skies	O
and	O

so	O
i	O
don't	O
know	O
wish	O
i	O
did	O

uh-huh	O
well	O
then	O
you	O
just	O
pay	O
it	O
off	O
at	O
the	O
end	O
of	O
the	O
month	O

well	O
i	O
don't	O
have	O
kids	O
so	O
it's	O
kind	O
of	O
hard	B-METAPHOR
to	O
say	O

well	O
i'm	O
in	O
Texas	O
and	O
we	O
have	O
a	O
teacher	O
that	O
died	O
from	O
AIDS	O

yeah	O
and	O
anytime	O
you	O
try	O
to	O
walk	O
down	O
the	O
uh	O
the	O
ushers	O
would	O
always	O
tell	O
you	O
to	O
go	O
back	O

yeah	O
well	O
her	O
name's	O
Sam	O
because	O
it's	O
like	O
short	O
for	O
Samantha	O
and	O
everybody	O
calls	O
her	O
him	O

mine	O
are	O
too	O
but	O
i	O
think	O
it's	O
a	O
real	O
real	O
a	O
real	O
serious	O
situation	O
for	O
a	O
lot	O
of	O
people	O

oh	O
and	O
then	O
if	O
you	O
try	O
to	O
get	O
it	O
outside	O
of	O
your	O
uh	O
corporation	O
you're	O
gonna	O
pay	O
an	O
arm	O
and	O
a	O
leg	O

i'm	O
looking	O
forward	O
to	O
it	O

i	O
i	O
can't	O
remember	O
i've	O
only	O
done	O
this	O
one	O
other	O
time	O

all	O
that	O
so	O
there's	O
a	O
lot	O
of	O
things	O
like	O
that	O
that	O
Texas	O
Instruments	O
makes	O
that	O
even	O
the	O
employees	O
don't	O
know	O
they	O
make	O
for	O
the	O
most	O
part	O

it's	O
real	O
real	O
dangerous	O
i	O
i	O
would	O
think	O
but	O
with	O
all	O
the	O
accidents	O

uh	O
that's	O
yeah	O
i'd	O
like	O
to	O
see	O
them	O
restrict	O
just	O
those	O
like	O
i	O
said	O
before	O
those	O
new	O
automatic	O
weapons	O
but	O
the	O
rest	O
of	O
it	O
i	O
don't	O
think	O
they	O
need	O
anymore	O

yeah	O
that's	O
another	O
thing	O
i	O
don't	O
understand	O
is	O
is	O
is	O
things	O
like	O
selling	O
technology	O
and	O
uh	O
even	O
military	O
hardware	O
to	O
foreign	O
governments	O
and	O
then	O
forgiving	O
their	O
debt	O

uh-huh	O
you	O
don't	O
feel	O
as	O
though	O
that	O
that's	O
a	O
decision	O
you're	O
comfortable	O
with	O
because	O

well	O
it	O
seems	O
to	O
me	O
that	O
that	O
i'm	O
paying	O
anyway	O
because	O
when	O
i	O
go	O
or	O
my	O
insurance	O
carrier	O
anyway	O
when	O
i	O
pay	O
something	O
the	O
bills	O
seem	O
inordinately	O
high	O

uh	O
well	O
computer	O
science	O
and	O
cognitive	O
science	O
so	O

is	O
it	O
we	O
have	O
almost	O
an	O
acre	O
yeah	O
it's	O
it's	O
funny	O
because	O
we	O
have	O
um	O

uh	O
you	O
know	O
they'll	O
be	O
gone	O
and	O
and	O
uh	O
there	O
won't	O
be	O
as	O
many	O
activities	O
do	O
you	O
uh	O

yeah	O
well	O
lately	O
about	O
my	O
only	O
halfway	B-METAPHOR
experience	O
with	O
camping	O
is	O
we	O
uh	O
my	O
husband	O
races	O
cars	O

but	O
aside	O
from	O
that	O
i	O
hope	O
it's	O
still	O
warm	O
not	O
too	O
cold	O
maybe	O
maybe	O
maybe	O
well	O
maybe	O
a	O
little	O
snow	O
on	O
Christmas	O
Eve	O
or	O
something	O
would	O
be	O
nice	O
but	O
it	O
doesn't	O
look	O
good	O

We	O
gate	O
our	O
entry	B-METAPHOR
into	O
the	O

And	O
if	O
so,	O
are	O
they	O
often	O
near	O
that	O
boundary?	B-METAPHOR

And	O
there	O
is,	O
I	O
think,	O
a	O
molecular	O
clue	B-METAPHOR
that	O
the	O
biosphere	O
is	O
persistently	O
coconstructing	B-METAPHOR
itself	O
in	O
the	O
survivable	O
regime	O
for	O
a	O

of	O

With	O
that	O
leap,	B-METAPHOR
a	O

Consequently,	O

I	O
want	O
to	O
say	O
that	O
the	O

The	O

As	O
the	O

The	O

that	O

him,	O
and	O
thereafter	O
with	O
Wolverstone,	O
leaning	B-METAPHOR
upon	O
the	O
rail,	O
he	O
watched	O
the	O
approach	O
of	O
that	O
boat,	O
manned	O
by	O
a	O
dozen	O
sailors,	O
and	O
commanded	O
by	O
a	O
scarlet	O
figure	O
seated	O
stiffly	O
in	O
the	O
stern	O
sheets.	O

Your	O
motives	O
were	O
no	O
doubt	O
worthy...	O
your	O
gratitude	O
to	O
him	O
for	O
delivering	O
you	O
from	O
the	O
Spaniards.	O

Why	O
did	O
ye	O
let	O
Wolverstone	O
and	O
the	O
others	O
go?	O
he	O
cried,	O
with	O
a	O
touch	B-METAPHOR
of	O
bitterness.	B-METAPHOR

It's	O
that	O
cursed	O
petticoat's	O
making	O
a	O
coward	O
of	O
you.	O

Ah!	O
And	O
what	O
way	O
may	O
that	O
be?	O

Ogle	O
wrenched	O
it	O
free,	O
with	O
an	O
oath.	O

I	O
do	O
not	O
grant	O
the	O
King's	O
commission	O
lightly.	B-METAPHOR

He	O
realized	O
that	O
he	O
might	O
have	O
to	O
retreat	O
in	O
a	O
hurry.	O

Even	O
now	O
Blood	O
had	O
no	O
eyes	O
for	O
that.	O

And	O
yet	O
he	O
has	O
been	O
what	O
he	O
has	O
been	O
and	O
done	O
what	O
he	O
has	O
done	O
in	O
these	O
last	O
three	O
years,	O
said	O
she,	O
but	O
she	O
said	O
it	O
sorrowfully	O
now,	O
without	O
any	O
of	O
her	O
earlier	O
scorn.	O

I	O
suppose	O
that	O
is	O
after	O
the	O
fashion	O
of	O
your	O
kind.	O

A	O
frown	O
rumpled	O
her	O
brow.	O

She	O
had	O
been	O
observing	O
him	O
with	O
shining	O
eyes,	O
but	O
at	O
sight	O
of	O
his	O
dejected	B-METAPHOR
countenance,	O
and	O
the	O
deep	O
frown	O
that	O
scarred	O
his	O
brow,	O
her	O
own	O
expression	O
changed.	O

Walking	O
leisurely,	O
he	O
skirted	O
the	O
embattled	O
wall,	O
and	O
passed	O
through	O
the	O
great	O
gates	O
into	O
the	O
courtyard.	O

Say	O
that	O
I	O
look	O
forward	O
to	O
making	O
his	O
acquaintance	O
there.	O
CHAPTER	O
XXII.	O

You'll	O
ruffle	O
it	O
to	O
the	O
gallows,	O
no	O
doubt,	O
he	O
said	O
contemptuously.	O

I	O
believe	O
that	O
it	O
was	O
nothing	O
but	O
the	O
hope	O
of	O
taking	O
and	O
hanging	O
Captain	O
Blood	O
that	O
made	O
my	O
uncle	O
leave	O
his	O
Barbados	O
plantations	O
to	O
accept	O
the	O
deputy-governorship	O
of	O
Jamaica.	O

How	O
could	O
I	O
in	O
honesty	O
have	O
detained	O
them?	O
It	O
was	O
in	O
the	O
bargain.	O

Colonel	O
Bishop	O
has	O
been	O
notified	O
of	O
my	O
coming.	O
The	O
sudden	O
change	O
in	O
Calverley's	O
manner	O
at	O
Lord	O
Julian's	O
mention	O
of	O
his	O
name	O
showed	B-METAPHOR
that	O
the	O
notification	O
had	O
been	O
received,	O
and	O
that	O
he	O
had	O
knowledge	O
of	O
it.	O

At	O
the	O
head	O
of	O
the	O
companion,	O
Ogle	O
found	O
his	O
progress	O
barred	B-METAPHOR
by	O
Blood,	O
who	O
confronted	O
him,	O
a	O
sudden	O
sternness	O
in	O
his	O
face	O
and	O
in	O
every	O
line	O
of	O
him.	O

I've	O
been	O
hunting	B-METAPHOR
him	O
this	O
year	O
past.	O

At	O
that	O
moment	O
a	O
lane	B-METAPHOR
was	O
opened	B-METAPHOR
in	O
the	O
ranks	O
of	O
the	O
men,	O
and	O
through	O
this	O
came	O
Miss	O
Bishop	O
followed	O
by	O
her	O
octoroon	O
woman.	O

They	O
are	O
ships	O
of	O
the	O
Jamaica	O
fleet,	O
his	O
lordship	O
answered	O
her.	O

And	O
for	O
what	O
had	O
he	O
placed	B-METAPHOR
himself	O
in	O
this	O
position?	B-METAPHOR
For	O
the	O
sake	O
of	O
a	O
girl	O
who	O
avoided	O
him	O
so	O
persistently	O
and	O
intentionally	O
that	O
he	O
must	O
assume	O
that	O
she	O
still	O
regarded	O
him	O
with	O
aversion.	O

You	O
may	O
be	O
right,	O
and	O
you	O
may	O
be	O
wrong.	O

You	O
have	O
granted,	O
I	O
am	O
told,	O
the	O
King's	O
commission	O
to	O
this	O
man.	O
His	O
very	O
tone	O
betrayed	B-METAPHOR
the	O
bitterness	B-METAPHOR
of	O
his	O
rancour.	O

She	O
was	O
very	O
white,	O
and	O
she	O
kept	O
her	O
eyes	O
upon	O
her	O
folded	O
hands.	O

So	O
they've	O
told	O
you	O
about	O
that!	O

She	O
realized	O
that	O
perhaps	O
she	O
had,	O
herself,	O
provoked	O
his	O
anger.	O

I	O
shall	O
always	O
be	O
grateful.	O

Not	O
for	O
his	O
niece,	O
not	O
for	O
his	O
daughter,	O
not	O
for	O
his	O
own	O
mother,	O
would	O
he	O
forgo	O
the	O
blood	O
what	O
he	O
thinks	O
due	O
to	O
him.	O

Abeam	O
with	O
the	O
Arabella,	O
across	O
the	O
harbour,	O
were	O
the	O
flat-fronted	O
white	O
buildings	O
of	O
that	O
imposing	O
city	O
that	O
came	O
down	O
to	O
the	O
very	O
water's	O
edge.	O

In	O
my	O
own	O
I've	O
done	O
nothing	O
at	O
all	O
that	O
I	O
am	O
ashamed	O
of,	O
considering	O
the	O
provocation	O
I	O
received.	O
Her	O
glance	O
faltered,	O
and	O
fell	B-METAPHOR
away	O
before	O
his	O
own	O
that	O
was	O
so	O
intent.	O

And	O
maybe	O
it	O
won't.	O
Slow	O
and	O
mocking	B-METAPHOR
came	B-METAPHOR
Wolverstone's	O
voice	O
to	O
answer	O
the	O
other's	O
confident	O
excitement,	O
and	O
as	O
he	O
spoke	O
he	O
advanced	O
to	O
Blood's	O
side,	O
an	O
unexpected	O
ally.	O

You	O
were	O
just	O
an	O
unfortunate	O
gentleman	O
then.	O

Captain	O
Blood	O
bared	O
his	O
head	O
and	O
bowed	O
silently	O
in	O
a	O
greeting	O
which	O
she	O
returned	O
composedly	O
and	O
formally.	O

There	O
had	O
been	O
trouble	O
with	O
Bishop	O
from	O
the	O
moment	O
of	O
landing.	O

Meanwhile	O
Ogle	O
was	O
growing	O
impatient.	O

Lord	O
Julian	O
was	O
sententious,	O
as	O
I	O
gather	O
that	O
he	O
often	O
was.	O

Aye--a	O
deal	O
of	O
lies,	O
devil	O
a	O
doubt,	O
as	O
I	O
could	O
prove	O
to	O
you.	O

But	O
I	O
was	O
in	O
haste	O
to	O
land	B-METAPHOR
you.	O

You	O
should	O
have	O
seen	O
the	O
danger.	O

I	O
realize	O
fully	O
what	O
you	O
did,	O
and	O
I	O
realize	O
that	O
partly,	O
at	O
least,	O
you	O
may	O
have	O
been	O
urged	O
by	O
consideration	O
for	O
myself.	O

I'll	O
not	O
be	O
detaining	O
you	O
any	O
longer,	O
ma'am.	O

It's	O
our	O
only	O
chance....	O
The	O
rest	O
of	O
his	O
words	O
were	O
drowned	B-METAPHOR
in	O
the	O
shouts	O
of	O
the	O
hands	O
insisting	O
that	O
the	O
girl	O
be	O
given	O
up	O
to	O
be	O
held	O
as	O
a	O
hostage.	O

That	O
is	O
not	O
in	O
the	O
bargain.	O

He	O
observed	O
her	O
pale	O
and	O
tense,	O
with	O
parted	O
lips	O
and	O
startled	O
eyes	O
that	O
were	O
fixed	O
upon	O
him,	O
an	O
anxious	O
witness	O
of	O
this	O
deciding	O
of	O
her	O
fate.	O

And	O
she	O
shivered	B-METAPHOR
at	O
the	O
memory	O
of	O
it.	O

Aye!	O
roared	O
in	O
chorus	O
the	O
buccaneers	O
below,	O
and	O
one	O
or	O
two	O
of	O
them	O
elaborated	O
that	O
affirmation.	O

In	O
the	O
cabin	O
he	O
flung	O
into	O
a	O
chair,	O
and	O
exploded,	O
with	O
a	O
violence	O
altogether	O
foreign	B-METAPHOR
to	O
his	O
nature.	O

I	O
killed	O
him,	O
it	O
is	O
true.	O

Captain,	O
he	O
said,	O
and	O
as	O
he	O
spoke	O
he	O
pointed	O
to	O
the	O
pursuing	O
ships,	O
Colonel	O
Bishop	O
holds	B-METAPHOR
us.	O

That'll	O
cool	B-METAPHOR
Colonel	O
Bishop's	O
heat,	O
maybe.	O

Your	O
station	O
is	O
on	O
the	O
gun-deck.	O

So	O
I	O
heard,	O
she	O
admitted	O
in	O
a	O
small	B-METAPHOR
voice.	O

But	O
laugh	O
though	O
he	O
might,	O
he	O
knew	O
as	O
well	O
as	O
Pitt	O
that	O
in	O
going	O
ashore	O
that	O
morning	O
he	O
carried	B-METAPHOR
his	O
life	O
in	O
his	O
hands.	O

I...	O
I	O
had	O
not	O
dreamed....	O

But	O
there	O
is	O
no	O
hope	O
for	O
him	O
in	O
that!	O
she	O
cried.	O

I	O
will	O
take	O
leave	O
to	O
doubt	O
it.	O
His	O
lordship's	O
tone	O
abated	O
nothing	O
of	O
its	O
asperity.	B-METAPHOR

There	O
was	O
here	O
quite	O
plainly	B-METAPHOR
a	O
vague	B-METAPHOR
threat,	O
a	O
mutinous	O
spirit	B-METAPHOR
he	O
could	O
not	O
understand.	O

Don't	O
be	O
forgetting	O
that.	O
Jeremy	O
clenched	O
his	O
hands.	O

But	O
it	O
gave	O
no	O
pause	O
to	O
the	O
gunner's	O
intention.	O

But	O
Blood's	O
mind	O
was	O
now	O
made	O
up.	O

Why,	O
as	O
I	O
was	O
just	O
telling	O
his	O
lordship	O
here,	O
who	O
thought	O
like	O
you	O
that	O
having	O
Miss	O
Bishop	O
aboard	O
would	O
make	O
us	O
safe,	O
not	O
for	O
his	O
mother	O
would	O
that	O
filthy	B-METAPHOR
slaver	O
forgo	O
what's	O
due	O
to	O
him.	O

In	O
his	O
cabin	O
on	O
the	O
starboard	O
side	O
Lord	O
Julian,	O
disturbed	O
by	O
the	O
same	O
sounds,	O
was	O
already	O
astir	O
and	O
hurriedly	O
dressing.	O

Let	O
me	O
present	O
Captain	O
Blood.	O
Perforce	O
Bishop	O
must	O
put	O
on	O
the	O
best	O
face	O
he	O
could	O
command.	O

Pitt,	O
at	O
his	O
post	O
beside	O
the	O
helmsman,	O
turned	O
intrepidly	O
to	O
face	O
the	O
excited	O
gunner.	O

Blood	O
leaned	O
over	O
the	O
rail	O
to	O
speak	O
to	O
the	O
fair	O
young	O
man	O
immediately	O
below	O
him	O
by	O
the	O
helmsman	O
at	O
the	O
whipstaff.	O

The	O
country	O
is	O
all,	O
sir;	O
the	O
sovereign	O
naught.	O

His	O
hand	O
closed	O
over	O
the	O
butt	O
of	O
one	O
of	O
the	O
pistols	O
slung	O
before	O
him.	O

It	O
gives	O
him	O
a	O
grievance	O
at	O
last.	O

Wait!	O
Blood	O
bade	B-METAPHOR
him,	O
interrupting,	O
and	O
he	O
set	O
a	O
restraining	O
hand	O
upon	O
the	O
gunner's	O
arm.	O

And	O
for	O
all	O
that	O
he	O
lost	O
nothing	O
of	O
his	O
outward	O
stern	B-METAPHOR
composure,	O
fear	O
invaded	B-METAPHOR
his	O
heart.	O

Through	O
her	O
and	O
through	O
you.	O

Though	O
we	O
had	O
a	O
cargo	O
of	O
Bishop's	O
nieces	O
it	O
wouldn't	O
make	O
him	O
hold	O
his	O
hand.	O

If	O
now	O
he	O
can	O
show	O
that....	O

That	O
is	O
what	O
we	O
were	O
advised.	O

How?	O
she	O
asked	O
him	O
with	O
a	O
sudden	O
startled	O
interest.	O

‘Twill	O
be	O
a	O
kindness,	O
so	O
it	O
will.	O
For	O
a	O
moment	O
she	O
stood	O
before	O
him	O
with	O
quickened	O
breathing,	O
the	O
colour	O
ebbing	B-METAPHOR
and	O
flowing	B-METAPHOR
in	O
her	O
cheeks.	O

He	O
was	O
moved	O
to	O
raise	B-METAPHOR
his	O
voice	O
above	O
its	O
usual	O
languid	O
level.	O

My	O
name	O
is	O
Wade--Lord	O
Julian	O
Wade.	O

I	O
see,	O
sir,	O
that	O
you	O
do	O
not	O
yet	O
quite	O
apprehend	B-METAPHOR
the	O
circumstances.	O

I	O
am	O
pressed,	B-METAPHOR
she	O
informed	O
him.	O

As	O
for	O
me,	O
said	O
Lord	O
Julian,	O
with	O
intent	O
to	O
make	O
Miss	O
Bishop's	O
departure	O
free	O
from	O
all	O
interference	O
on	O
the	O
part	O
of	O
the	O
buccaneers,	O
I	O
shall	O
remain	O
aboard	O
the	O
Arabella	O
until	O
we	O
reach	O
Port	O
Royal.	O

Then:	O
You	O
ordered	O
it?	O
he	O
said	O
in	O
accents	O
of	O
unbelief,	O
whilst	O
Lord	O
Julian	O
raised	O
his	O
eyebrows.	O

Expressly.	O
His	O
lordship	O
waited	O
a	O
moment	O
for	O
a	O
reply.	O

You	O
know,	O
Peter,	O
that	O
it	O
is	O
Lord	O
Julian	O
alone	O
has	O
stood	O
between	O
Bishop	O
and	O
his	O
hate	O
of	O
you.	O

But	O
many	O
could	O
not	O
resolve	O
one	O
way	B-METAPHOR
or	O
the	O
other	O
until	O
they	O
were	O
satisfied	O
upon	O
several	O
questions,	O
and	O
chiefly	O
upon	O
one	O
which	O
was	O
voiced	O
by	O
Ogle.	O

Ye're	O
going	O
to	O
deliver	B-METAPHOR
yourself	O
into	O
Bishop's	O
hands,	B-METAPHOR
Pitt	O
warned	O
him.	O

Standing	O
beside	O
Captain	O
Blood,	O
he	O
looked	O
astern,	O
following	O
the	O
indication	O
of	O
the	O
Captain's	O
hand,	O
and	O
cried	B-METAPHOR
out	O
in	O
his	O
amazement.	O

He	O
may	O
be	O
right,	O
and	O
he	O
may	O
be	O
wrong.	O

But	O
if	O
she	O
resented	O
his	O
tone	O
and	O
his	O
words,	O
she	O
stifled	O
her	O
resentment.	O

I	O
am	O
informed	O
that	O
yesterday	O
evening	O
a	O
frigate	O
left	O
the	O
harbour	O
having	O
on	O
board	O
your	O
associate	O
Wolverstone	O
and	O
a	O
hundred	O
men	O
of	O
the	O
hundred	O
and	O
fifty	O
that	O
were	O
serving	O
under	O
you.	O

And	O
instantly	O
would	O
have	O
recalled	O
the	O
words	O
had	O
she	O
been	O
able.	O

But	O
that	O
it	O
was	O
no	O
more	O
than	O
a	O
mask	B-METAPHOR
for	O
his	O
fury	O
and	O
his	O
venom	B-METAPHOR
was	O
plain	O
to	O
all.	O

Levasseur?	O
He	O
smiled	O
a	O
little.	O

HOSTILITIES	O
In	O
the	O
great	O
harbour	O
of	O

of	O
the	O

the	O
Arabella	O
rode	O
at	O

He	O
swung	B-METAPHOR
to	O
Lord	O
Julian.	O

Good-morning	O
to	O
you,	O
he	O
said,	O
and	O
added	O
I've	O
blundered	O
badly,	O
so	O
I	O
have.	O

He	O
stepped	O
back,	O
a	O
baffled,	O
impotent	O
man.	O

Although	O
even	O
some	O
o'	O
they	O
should	O
know	O
better,	O
for	O
there's	O
still	O
a	O

with	O
Colonel	O

Pitt,	O
loosely	O
clad	O
in	O
shirt	O
and	O
breeches,	O
leaned	B-METAPHOR
against	O
the	O
rail	O
the	O
while	O
and	O
watched	O
him,	O
unmistakable	O
concern	O
imprinted	B-METAPHOR
on	O
his	O
fair,	O
frank	O
countenance.	O

That'll	O
be	O
the	O
signal	O
to	O
lie	O
to,	O
said	O
Blood,	O
in	O
the	O
same	O
listless	O
voice;	O
and	O
he	O
fetched	O
a	O
sigh.	O

And	O
what	O
better	O
are	O
these?--Are	O
ye	O
afeard	O
of	O
a	O
lubberly	O
Barbados	O
planter?	O
Whatever	O
ails	O
you,	O
Peter?	O
I've	O
never	O
known	O
ye	O
scared	O
afore.	O
A	O
gun	O
boomed	O
out	O
behind	O
them.	O

And	O
a	O
couple	O
of	O
miles	O
this	O
side	O
of	O
it,	O
bearing	O
after	O
them,	O
came	O
speeding	O
three	O
great	O
white	O
ships.	O

It's	O
our	O
only	O
chance,	O
I've	O
said,	O
and	O
we	O
must	O
take	O
it.	O
The	O
better	O
way	B-METAPHOR
that	O
was	O
in	O
Captain	O
Blood's	O
mind	O
was	O
the	O
way	B-METAPHOR
that	O
already	O
he	O
had	O
proposed	O
to	O
Wolverstone.	O

The	O
young	O
master's	O
grey	O
eyes	O
skimmed	B-METAPHOR
it.	O

Whether	O
the	O
men	O
in	O
the	O
panic	O
Ogle	O
had	O
aroused	O
among	O
them	O
would	O
take	O
a	O
different	O
view	B-METAPHOR
from	O
Wolverstone's	O
he	O
did	O
not	O
know.	O

Heave	O
her	O
to,	O
and	O
signal	O
to	O
them	O
to	O
send	O
a	O
boat.	O
A	O
silence	O
of	O
astonishment	O
fell	B-METAPHOR
upon	O
the	O
ship--of	O
astonishment	O
and	O
suspicion	O
at	O
this	O
sudden	O
yielding.	O

I	O
accept	O
it	O
as	O
the	O
only	O
way	O
to	O
save	O
us	O
all	O
from	O
the	O
certain	O
destruction	B-METAPHOR
into	O
which	O
my	O
own	O
act	O
may	O
have	O
brought	O
us.	O

I...	O
I	O
can't	O
think	O
why	O
you	O
should	O
speak	O
to	O
me	O
like	O
this,	O
she	O
said,	O
with	O
less	O
than	O
her	O
earlier	O
assurance.	O

And	O
the	O
quixotic	O
fool	O
is	O
running	B-METAPHOR
into	O
danger	O
at	O
the	O
present	O
moment	O
on	O
our	O
behalf.	O

A	O
thin,	O
sour	B-METAPHOR
smile	O
broke	B-METAPHOR
on	O
the	O
officer's	O
haughty	B-METAPHOR
lips.	O

So	O
that	O
ye	O
can	O
be	O
charitable	O
in	O
some	O
ways!	B-METAPHOR
He	O
laughed	O
softly.	B-METAPHOR

Hark	O
to	O
the	O
gentleman!	O
he	O
mocked.	O

Threats	O
will	O
not	O
serve,	O
Captain.	O

Captain	O
Blood's	O
glance	O
raked	B-METAPHOR
the	O
ranks	O
of	O
those	O
resolute,	O
fierce-eyed	B-METAPHOR
fellows,	O
then	O
it	O
came	O
to	O
rest	O
again	O
on	O
Ogle.	O

If	O
ye're	O
counting	O
on	O
pulling	B-METAPHOR
Bishop's	O
heartstrings,	B-METAPHOR
ye're	O
a	O
bigger	O
fool,	O
Ogle,	O
than	O
I've	O
always	O
thought	O
you	O
was	O
with	O
anything	O
but	O
guns.	B-METAPHOR

He	O
had	O
found	O
the	O
only	O
way,	B-METAPHOR
and	O
repellent	B-METAPHOR
though	O
it	O
might	O
be	O
to	O
him,	O
he	O
must	O
take	O
it.	O

He	O
threw	O
them	O
at	O
me	O
again	O
and	O
again.	O

That	O
is:	O
that	O
he	O
has	O
been	O
notified	O
of	O
the	O
coming	O
of	O
Lord	O
Julian	O
Wade.	O

Oh,	O
please.	O
There	O
was	O
real	O
alarm	O
in	O
her	O
voice.	O

Fearing	O
to	O
betray	O
the	O
latter,	O
she	O
took	O
refuge	O
in	O
the	O
former.	O

You	O
take	O
that	O
tone!	O
You	O
dare	O
to	O
take	O
that	O
tone!	O
she	O
cried,	O
astounding	O
him	O
by	O
her	O
sudden	O
vehemence.	O

You	O
may	O
have	O
heard	O
of	O
me.	O
Captain	O
Calverley	O
stared	O
hard.	B-METAPHOR

It	O
isn't	O
that.	O
But	O
they	O
were	O
fated	O
to	O
misunderstand	O
each	O
other.	O

If	O
anything	O
should	O
happen	O
to	O
you,	O
Peter,	O
he	O
said,	O
as	O
Blood	O
was	O
going	O
over	O
the	O
side,	O
Colonel	O
Bishop	O
had	O
better	O
look	O
to	O
himself.	O

I'll	O
be	O
getting	O
my	O
hat	O
and	O
cane	O
and	O
sword,	O
and	O
go	O
ashore	O
in	O
the	O
cock-boat.	O

I	O
must	O
return	O
to	O
Colonel	O
Bishop	O
for	O
my	O
orders,	O
he	O
informed	O
them.	O

In	O
a	O
flash	B-METAPHOR
Captain	O
Blood	O
saw	O
what	O
was	O
in	O
their	O
minds.	O

I	O
do	O
my	O
best,	O
said	O
she.	O

Oh,	O
but--by	O
your	O
leave--surely	O
there	O
is	O
nothing	O
to	O
be	O
apprehended	B-METAPHOR
from	O
Colonel	O
Bishop.	O

I	O
wonder,	O
now,	O
he	O
said	O
presently,	O
if	O
the	O
mischief	O
is	O
of	O
your	O
working.	O

Shrewd	O
advocacy,	O
he	O
approved	O
it.	O

I	O
have	O
something	O
to	O
show	O
you.	O
Wondering,	O
Lord	O
Julian	O
mounted	O
the	O
companion	O
as	O
he	O
was	O
bidden.	O

Before	O
we've	O
run	O
another	O
half-mile	O
we	O
shall	O
be	O
within	O
range.	O
Wolverstone	O
swore	O
elaborately,	O
then	O
suddenly	O
checked.	O

He's	O
chivalrous	O
to	O
the	O
point	O
of	O
idiocy.	O

He	O
levelled	O
his	O
telescope	O
upon	O
that	O
figure.	O

Miss	O
Bishop	O
was	O
aboard	O
the	O
Royal	O
Mary	O
also,	O
and	O
I	O
rescued	O
her	O
together	O
with	O
his	O
lordship.	O

What	O
if	O
he	O
can?	O
Blood	O
interrupted	O
carelessly.	O

I'll	O
rot	B-METAPHOR
in	O
hell	B-METAPHOR
or	O
ever	O
I	O
serves	O
the	O
King,	O
he	O
bawled	O
in	O
a	O
great	O
rage.	O

Ye're	O
surely	O
daft	O
even	O
to	O
think	O
of	O
it,	O
Peter!	O

Standing	O
now	O
at	O
the	O
rail,	O
with	O
Lord	O
Julian	O
beside	O
him,	O
Captain	O
Blood	O
explained	O
himself.	O

A	O
boat	O
that	O
had	O
approached	O
unnoticed	O
from	O
the	O

came	O
scraping	O

bumping	O
against	O
the	O
great	O
red	O
hull	O
of	O
the	O
Arabella,	O
and	O
a	O
raucous	O
voice	O
sent	B-METAPHOR
up	O
a	O
hailing	B-METAPHOR
shout.	O

Ye'll	O
remember	O
afterwards	O
that	O
it	O
was	O
your	O
hardness	B-METAPHOR
drove	B-METAPHOR
me.	O
She	O
moved	O
to	O
depart,	O
then	O
checked,	O
and	O
faced	O
him	O
again.	O

Faith,	O
you	O
explain	O
yourself	O
after	O
a	O
fashion,	O
said	O
he.	O

A	O
drinker	O
of	O
blood,	O
he	O
is.	O

It's	O
the	O
truth,	O
you	O
fool.	O

Heave	O
to,	O
Captain,	O
and	O
signal	O
them	O
to	O
send	O
a	O
boat,	O
and	O
assure	O
themselves	O
that	O
Miss	O
is	O
here.	O

And	O
if	O
ye'	O
weren't	O
a	O
fool,	O
Ogle,	O
you	O
wouldn't	O
need	O
me	O
to	O
tell	O
you	O
this.	O

And	O
what	O
should	O
be	O
happening	O
to	O
me,	O
Jeremy?	O
Sure,	O
now,	O
I'll	O
be	O
