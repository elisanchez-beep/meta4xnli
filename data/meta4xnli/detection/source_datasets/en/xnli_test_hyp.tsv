I	O

I	O
just	O

talking	O
to	O
him	O

We	O
had	O
a	O

talk.	O

I	O
was	O
not	O

that	O
I	O
was	O
not	O
the	O

to	O
be	O
at	O

I	O

at	O

We	O

no	O

what	O

we	O
were	O

The	O

I	O
want	O

I	O

I	O
wont	O
talk	O
about	O
the	O

there's	O
too	O
much	O
to	O

We	O
didn't	O
care	O
about	O

anything.	O

We	O

more	O

We	O
wanted	O
to	O

I	O

I	O
was	O
so	O

I	O
was	O
too	O

that	O

I've	O

The	O

the	O

There's	O
a	O

caused	O
by	O
this	O
odd	O
wiring.	O

I'm	O
not	O
at	O
all	O
surprised	O
that	O
they	O
were	O
leinient.	O

I'm	O
surprised	O
that	O
they	O
let	O
you	O
take	O
food	O
and	O
drinks	O
in	O
there.	O

I'm	O
surprised	O
what	O
they	O
could	O
get	O
away	O
with.	O

It	O
costs	O
$2000	O
to	O
buy	O
everything	O
you	O
need.	O

It	O
costs	O
a	O
lot	O
to	O
outfit	O
yourself.	O

It's	O
really	O
cheap	O
to	O
get	O
outfitted.	O

I	O
do	O
not	O
need	O
to	O
because	O
my	O
children	O
are	O
over	O
the	O
age	O
of	O
twenty.	O

I	O
might	O
have	O
to	O
since	O
they	O
are	O
close	B-METAPHOR

I	O
must	O
since	O
they	O
are	O
both	O
ten	O

eleven	O

I	O
was	O
born	O
in	O

I'm	O
not	O

where	O

I'm	O
telling	O
you	O
that	O
this	O

who	O

They	O

Can	O
you	O
explain	O
how	O
you'd	O
perform	O
aerobics?	O

I'm	O
interested	O
in	O
aerobics	O
because	O
I	O
need	O
some	O
cardiovascular	O
activity.	O

Please	O
stop	O
talking	O
about	O
aerobics.	O

That's	O
a	O
dumb	O
idea	O
I	O
discarded	O
last	O

That's	O
a	O
good	O
point.	O

The	O
paradox	O
you	O
mention	O
is	O
a	O
good	O
point.	O

The	O
day	O

is	O
open	O
every	O

for	O
children	O
under	O
the	O

They	O
do	O
let	O
them	O
go	O
more	O
than	O
twice	O
a	O
week	O
if	O
the	O
senior	O
citizens	O
are	O
up	O
to	O
it.	O

They	O
refer	O
to	O
it	O
as	O
a	O
senior	O
day	O
care	O
but	O
it	O
is	O
called	O
the	O
senior	O

That	O
is	O
what	O
they	O
had	O
been	O

for.	O

That	O
was	O
never	O
what	O
they	O

They	O

Half	O

The	O

way	B-METAPHOR
forward	O
for	O

is	O
to	O

I	O

where	O
it	O
may	O

It	O

What	O

you	O

I	O
might	O

I	O
was	O

that	O

13	O

They	O

All	O
I	O

about	O

Only	O
a	O

never	O

about	O

How	O

How	O

Chaos	O

all	O
you	O
get	O
from	O
it.	O

It	O
is	O
very	O
calm	O
and	O
doesn't	O
cause	O
any	O
problems.	O

Some	O
people	O
like	O
the	O
chaos	O
it	O
creates.	O

I	O
have	O
already	O
seen	O
Darkman	O
about	O
4	O
times.	O

I	O
haven't	O
seen	O
Darkman	O
yet	O
so	O
I	O
decided	O
to	O
get	O
it	O
to	O
watch	O
tonight.	O

I	O
heard	O
that	O
Darkman	O
was	O
a	O
good	O
movie.	O

I	O
have	O
been	O
reading	O
since	O
I	O
can	O
remember.	O

I	O
was	O
an	O
English	O
major	O
so	O
I	O
like	O
reading.	O

I	O
was	O
an	O
English	O
major	O
that	O
led	O
me	O
to	O
poverty	O
which	O
is	O
why	O
I	O
cannot	O
stand	O
to	O
touch	B-METAPHOR
a	O
single	O
novel.	O

He	O
stole	O
the	O
parrot.	O

I	O
could	O
not	O
believe	O
he	O
paid	O
$1800	O
for	O
a	O
parrot.	O

The	O
parrot	O
was	O
beautiful	O
with	O
multiple	O
colors.	O

Minorities	O
may	O
have	O
the	O
upper	B-METAPHOR
advantage	O
in	O
this	O
case.	O

Unfortunately,	O
you	O
are	O
stuck	B-METAPHOR
being	O
a	O
minority.	O

You	O
are	O
not	O
a	O
minority.	O

I	O
like	O
the	O
coverage	B-METAPHOR
it	O
has	O
because	O
I	O
never	O
have	O
time	O
to	O
sit	O
and	O
read	O
the	O
paper.	O

I	O
take	O
at	O
least	O
an	O
hour	O
a	O
day	O
to	O
read	O
the	O
paper	O
just	O
so	O
I	O
dont	O
have	O
to	O
watch	O
it.	O

They	O
cover	B-METAPHOR
a	O
lot	O
more	O
than	O
you	O
will	O
get	O
from	O
the	O
paper.	O

I	O
am	O
not	O
a	O
rap	O
fan	O
but	O
I	O
do	O
like	O
some	O
of	O
the	O
songs	O
they	O
have.	O

I	O
love	O
rap	O
but	O
their	O
songs	O
are	O
horrible.	O

They	O
had	O
a	O
few	O
number	O
one	O
hits.	B-METAPHOR

From	O
what	O
I	O
have	O
come	O
across	O
it	O
sounds	O
like	O
accomplishment.	O

I	O
have	O
gathered	O
from	O
the	O
meeting	O
that	O
things	O
went	O
very	O
well.	O

I	O
have	O
heard	O
nothing	O
but	O
complaints	O
to	O
be	O
honest.	O

Testing	O
does	O
take	O
time	O
especially	O
with	O
the	O
construction	O
of	O
building	O
concrete	O
holes.	O

They	O
need	O
to	O
give	O
it	O
time	O
for	O
the	O
concrete	O
to	O
set	O
before	O
beginning	O
any	O
tests.	O

Time	O
is	O
not	O
needed	O
when	O
building	O
something	O
out	O
of	O
concrete,	O
it	O
dries	O
quick	O
and	O
can	O
be	O
tested	O
right	O
away.	O

Sometimes	O
it	O
is	O
in	O
house	O
people	O
who	O
assist	O
you.	O

They	O
never	O
use	O
in	O
house	O
people	O
to	O
assist	O
you.	O

You	O
certainly	O
need	O
help	O
if	O
you	O
are	O
trying	O
to	O
handle	O
X	O

of	O

After	O
he	O
snapped	B-METAPHOR
out	O
of	O

he	O
seemed	O
to	O

again.	O

He	O
never	O
snapped	B-METAPHOR
out	O
of	O
it.	O

He	O
was	O
only	O
out	O

it	O
for	O
about	O
2	O

That	O

What	O

you	O
looking	O
for	O

you	O

Talking	O
to	O
you	O
has	O
been	O
very	O
annoying.	O

This	O
has	O
been	O
a	O
nice	O

We	O
will	O

again	O
soon.	O

Even	O
if	O
it	O
is	O
not	O
required	O
it	O
should	O
be	O
done.	O

It	O
is	O
strange	O
that	O
the	O
state	O
doesn't	O
require	O
it.	O

That	O
makes	O
sense	O
that	O
the	O
state	O
requires	O
it.	O

Some	O

I	O
don't	O
believe	O
he	O
wants	O
to	O
be	O
in	O
that	O
position.	B-METAPHOR

I	O
don't	O
think	O
he	O
wants	O
to	O
be	O
king.	O

I	O
know	O
he	O
would	O
love	O
to	O
do	O
that!	O

I	O
understand	O
it	O
very	O
well.	O

I	O
was	O
a	O
little	O
confused.	O

I	O
was	O
confused	O
about	O
how	O
it	O

I	O
also	O

a	O

I	O

two	O

My	O

I	O
knew	O
instantly	O
that	O
the	O

Piece	O

I	O
often	O
have	O
trouble	O
recalling	O
names	O
on	O
the	O
spot.	O

The	O
name	O
escaped	B-METAPHOR
me	O
at	O
first	O
but	O
it	O
is	O
referred	O
to	O
as	O
the	O
Peace	O
of	O

It's	O
an	O

It's	O

My	O

really	O

books	O

.	O

I	O
got	O
a	O
PJ	O

book	O
at	O
the	O

yesterday.	O

I	O
never	O

I	O
think	O
it	O
is	O
close	B-METAPHOR
to	O
twenty	O
minutes	O
but	O
I'm	O
not	O
positive.	O

It	O
is	O
approximately	O
twenty	O
minutes.	O

It	O
is	O
exactly	O
ten	O
minutes	O
long.	O

It	O
is	O
pretty	O
close	B-METAPHOR
to	O
what	O
I	O
mean.	O

No,	O
that	O
is	O
not	O
true	O
at	O
all.	O

Yes,	O
that	O
is	O
the	O
truth.	O

It	O
is	O
astounding	O
how	O
a	O
little	O
can	O
produce	O
a	O
lot.	O

People	O
love	O
finding	O
out	O
how	O
much	O
they	O
can	O
get	O
out	O
of	O
so	O
little.	O

There	O
is	O
no	O
way	B-METAPHOR
that	O
so	O
little	O
would	O
be	O
enough.	O

I	O
knew	O
ahead	O
of	O
time	O
that	O
someone	O
would	O
die	O
and	O
that	O
it	O
would	O
be	O
depressing.	O

I	O
was	O
hoping	O
that	O
it	O
would	O
have	O
some	O
lighthearted	O
moments.	O

I	O
was	O
not	O
expecting	O
anyone	O
to	O
die.	O

Of	O
course,	O
getting	B-METAPHOR
out	I-METAPHOR
of	O

Yes	O
getting	O
in	O
the	O
way	B-METAPHOR
of	O
each	O
other.	O

Yes,	O
it	O
could	O
be	O
seen	O
as	O
a	O
barrier	B-METAPHOR

each	O

All	O
my	O

It	O
holds	B-METAPHOR
a	O
lot	O
more	O

than	O
you	O

It	O
is	O
ridiculous	O
that	O
you	O
can	O
hardly	B-METAPHOR
fit	O
any	O
plants	O
in	O
there	O
at	O
all.	O

The	O
number	O
of	O
plants	O
it	O
can	O
hold	B-METAPHOR
depends	O
upon	O
the	O
types	O
of	O

I	O

It's	O
not	O
that	O
expensive	B-METAPHOR
to	O

This	O
is	O
the	O
most	O

If	O
you	O

just	O
a	O

you	O
can	O

If	O

he	O

over	O

into	O

The	O

him	O
there.	O

He	O
thought	O
someone	O
would	O
be	O
going	O
to	O
the	O

He	O
was	O
a	O
sheriff	O
who	O
had	O

He	O
whispered	O
a	O
way	B-METAPHOR

I	O
believe	O
my	O
uncle	O
wanted	O
to	O
see	O
Captain	O
Blood	O
dead	O
because	O
of	O
his	O
crimes.	O

My	O

left	O
his	O
Barbados	O

before	O
accepting	O
a	O

My	O

used	O
to	O
love	O
Captain	O
Blood	O
and	O
he	O
never	O
left	O
his	O
plantations	O
in	O
Barbados.	O

I	O
could	O
not	O
bring	O
myself	O
to	O
detain	O
them.	O

I	O
detained	O
them	O
as	O
soon	O
as	O
I	O
saw	O
them.	O

I	O
would	O
not	O
have	O
forgiven	O
myself,	O
if	O
I	O
had	O
detained	O
them.	O

Both	O
Colonel	O

Colonel	O

when	O
my	O

I	O
rode	O
to	O
the	O
Bishop	O
and	O
Calverly	O
by	O

Blood	O
was	O
grumpy	O
because	O
he	O
hadn't	O
had	O
anything	O
to	O
eat.	O

Ogle	O
didn't	O
meet	B-METAPHOR
with	O
any	O

when	O
he	O

Ogle's	O
advancement	B-METAPHOR
was	O
blocked	B-METAPHOR
by	O

who	O
looked	O
sternly	O
at	O
him	O
while	O
he	O
met	O
him	O
with	O
argumentative	O

I	O
have	O

him	O

for	O
a	O

without	O

I	O

to	O
a	O

Over	O
the	O

I	O

Miss	O

His	O

told	O
her	O
that	O
ships	O
came	O
from	O
the	O
Jamaica	O
fleet.	O

The	O
ships	O
of	O
the	O
Jamaica	O

impressed	O
her,	O
that's	O
why	O
she	O
asked	O
about	O
them.	O

They	O
are	O
ships	O
of	O
the	O
American	O
fleet,	O
his	O
lordship	O
answered	O
her.	O

He	O
liked	O
the	O
girl	O
so	O
he	O
put	O
himself	O
in	O
a	O
bad	O
position.	O

He	O
placed	O
himself	O
in	O
a	O
position	O
for	O
a	O
girl	O
that	O
didn't	O
pay	O
attention	O
to	O
him.	O

He	O
put	O
himself	O
in	O
his	O
current	O
position	B-METAPHOR
for	O
a	O
girl	O
that	O
was	O
obsessed	O
with	O
him.	O

You	O
are	O
definitely	O
wrong.	O

You	O
may	O
be	O
right	O
about	O
several	O
situations,	O
but	O
you	O
may	O
be	O
wrong	O
too.	O

You	O
may	O
be	O
wrong	O
but	O
it's	O
possible	O
that	O
you're	O
right	O

I'm	O
sure	O
you	O
didn't	O
grant	O
the	O
King's	O
commission	O
to	O
this	O
man,	O
he	O
said	O
cheerfully.	O

His	O
tone	O
denounced	O
the	O
bitterness	B-METAPHOR
of	O
his	O
resentment.	O

You	O
have	O
granted,	O
I	O
am	O
told,	O
the	O
King's	O
commission	O
to	O
the	O
man	O
because	O
of	O
his	O
bravery.	O

She	O
was	O
blue	O
and	O
she	O
kept	O
her	O
eyes	O
closed	O
all	O
the	O
time.	O

She	O
was	O
very	O
pale	O
and	O
she	O
kept	O
her	O
eyes	O
on	O
her	O
hands.	O

She	O
was	O
very	O
white	O
because	O
she	O
used	O
to	O
live	O
in	O
a	O
cold	O
country.	O

So	O
they	O
didn't	O
tell	O
you	O
about	O
our	O
situation!	O

So	O
they've	O
told	O
you	O
about	O
the	O
difficult	O
situation!	O

So	O
you	O
were	O
told	O
about	O
that!	O

He	O
was	O
angry	O
because	O
she	O
always	O
talks	O
too	O
much.	O

He	O
was	O
very	O
happy,	O
so	O
she	O
wasn't	O
worried	O
about	O
his	O
anger.	O

She	O
thought	O
she	O
may	O
have	O
provoked	O
his	O
anger.	O

I	O
am	O

I	O
am	O
so	O
happy	O
and	O
grateful	O
for	O
what	O
you	O

done	O
today.	O

I	O
will	O
forever	O
be	O
filled	B-METAPHOR
with	O
malice	O
and	O
hatred.	O

He	O
wanted	O
revenge	O
more	O
than	O
anything	O
else	O
in	O
the	O
world.	O

He	O
would	O
forgo	O
the	O
blood	O
due	O
to	O
him	O
if	O
his	O
mom	O
asked	O
him	O
to.	O

He	O

the	O

him	O
for	O
his	O

The	O
Arabella	O
came	O

a	O

that	O
was	O

on	O
a	O

The	O

where	O
the	O

The	O

I'm	O

anything	O

the	O

I'm	O
very	O
ashamed	O
of	O
everything,	O
I	O
need	O
to	O
apologize	O
immediately.	O

I've	O
done	O
nothing	O
at	O
all	O
that	O
I	O
am	O
ashamed	O
of	O
because	O
I	O
was	O
heavily	B-METAPHOR
provoked.	O

Blood	O
was	O
the	O
captain	O
of	O
a	O
ship	O
and	O
Wolverstone	O
was	O
his	O
best	O
friend.	O

Wolverstone	O
had	O
voiced	O
his	O
opinion	O
in	O
a	O

that	O
was	O

as	O
he	O

his	O

Wolverstone	O
remained	O

as	O
he	O

his	O

away	O

Back	O
then	O
you	O

In	O
the	O

you	O
were	O
an	O

You	O
were	O
unfortunate	O
but	O
now	O
you	O
have	O
a	O
better	O
circumstance.	O

Captain	O
Blood	O
bowed	O
silently	O
because	O
he	O
was	O
a	O
quiet	O
man.	O

Captain	O
Blood	O
completely	O
ignored	O
her	O
presence	O
and	O
she	O
didn't	O
even	O
notice	O
him.	O

She	O
responded	O
to	O
Captain	O

greeting	O
in	O
a	O
formal	O

way.	B-METAPHOR

There	O

problems	O
with	O

the	O

There	O
had	O

There	O

Ogle	O

I	O

Lord	O

I	O

Lord	O

he	O

Lord	O
Julian	O
was	O
sententious	O

wise,	O
as	O
I	O
gather	O
that	O
he	O
often	O
was	O
because	O
of	O
his	O
position	O

I	O
could	O
not	O
possibly	O
prove	O
to	O
you	O
anything	O
at	O

I	O
could	O

of	O
all	O
the	O
evidence	O
I	O

without	O

I	O
could	O

The	O

You	O

not	O
look	B-METAPHOR
at	O
the	O
crisis	O
happening	O
at	O
this	O
very	O
moment.	O

You	O
need	O
to	O
pay	O
more	O
attention.	O

You	O
really	O
need	O
to	O
be	O
aware	O
of	O
the	O

happening.	O

I	O
have	O
no	O
understanding	O
of	O
what	O
you	O

or	O
why	O
you	O

it.	O

You	O
had	O

me	O
because	O
it	O

You	O

I	O

One	O
of	O
the	O
only	O
opportunities	O

to	O
hand	O

the	O

To	O

She	O

he	O

her.	O

She	O

She	O
exclaimed	O
with	O
delight	O
at	O
just	O
the	O

She	O
was	O

the	O

His	O

His	O

the	O

He	O

very	O

the	O
threat	O
that	O
was	O
before	O
him.	O

The	O
threat	O
was	O
vague	B-METAPHOR
because	O
the	O

Jeremey	O

I	O

Captain.	O

Pitt	O
and	O
the	O
gunner	O
were	O
both	O
excited	O
because	O
they	O
had	O
just	O
made	O
a	O
huge	O
success.	O

The	O
gunner	O
was	O
feeling	O
giddy	O
as	O
Pitt	O
went	O
beside	O
him.	O

The	O
gunner	O
was	O
feeling	O
grim	O
as	O
Pitt	O
approached	O
him.	O

Blood	O
had	O
walked	O
right	O
past	O
the	O
helmsman,	O
ignoring	O
him	O
entirely.	O

Blood	O
wanted	O
to	O
talk	O
to	O
the	O
helmsman	O
to	O
figure	O
out	O
when	O
they	O
would	O
eat	O
together.	O

There	O
was	O
a	O
fair	O
young	O
man	O
who	O
happened	O
to	O
be	O
the	O
helmsman.	O

The	O
country	O
is	O
merely	O
a	O
part	O
of	O
the	O
whole,	O
sir.	O

The	O
country	O
is	O
not	O
a	O
sovereign	O
one.	O

Years	O
of	O
chaos	O
has	O
rendered	O
the	O
land	O
unstable.	O

He	O
had	O
armed	O
himself	O
as	O
he	O
was	O
about	O
to	O
enter	O
a	O
more	O
dangerous	O
part	O
of	O
town.	O

He	O
had	O
lost	O
his	O
gun	O
and	O
did	O
not	O
have	O
it	O
on	O
his	O
person.	O

He	O
had	O
put	O
a	O
gun	O
right	O
on	O
himself.	O

Finally,	O
it	O
had	O
provided	O
him	O
with	O
some	O
grievance.	O

It	O
did	O
not	O
provide	O
to	O
him,	O
any	O
grievances	O
in	O
the	O
least.	O

The	O
death	O
of	O
a	O
family	O
member	O
had	O
brought	B-METAPHOR
him	O
much	O
sadness.	O

Blood	O
allowed	O
the	O
gunner	O
to	O
carry	O
on	O
with	O
what	O
he	O
had	O
to	O
say.	O

Blood	O
had	O
put	O
his	O
hand	O
up	O
against	O
the	O
gunner's	O
arm	O
in	O
an	O
attempt	O
to	O
hold	O
him	O
back.	O

Blood	O
needed	O
to	O
speak	O
privately	O
to	O
the	O
gunner.	O

He	O
was	O
feeling	O
very	O
worried	O
because	O
he	O
had	O
forgotten	O
something	O
rather	O
important.	O

His	O
composure	O
remained	O
steadfast	B-METAPHOR
as	O
his	O
heart	O
filled	B-METAPHOR
with	O
relief.	O

His	O
heart	O
was	O
mostly	O
filled	B-METAPHOR
with	O
anxiety	O
as	O
his	O
composure	O
broke.	B-METAPHOR

Right	O
passed	O
the	O
both	O
of	O
them.	O

The	O
bullet	O
went	O
cleanly	B-METAPHOR
through	O
both	O
participants.	O

Through	O
the	O
both	O
of	O
them.	O

His	O
hand	O
had	O
been	O
forcibly	O
held	O
by	O
the	O
Bishop's	O
nieces	O
at	O
all	O
times.	O

His	O
hand	O
was	O
not	O
held	O
by	O
the	O
Bishop's	O
nieces.	O

They	O
would	O
only	O
hold	O
his	O
hand	O
in	O
times	O
of	O
great	O
stress.	O

He	O
certainly	O
is	O
unable	O
to	O
show	O
this.	O

He	O
might	O
be	O
able	O
to	O
demonstrate	O
this.	O

He	O
needed	O
to	O
show	O
off	O
his	O
skills.	O

This	O
was	O
not	O
what	O
we	O
were	O
informed	O
on.	O

We	O
were	O
told	O
this.	O

When	O
being	O
told	O
what	O
to	O
do,	O
management	O
failed	O
to	O
let	O
us	O
in	O
on	O
the	O
trade	O
secrets.	O

She	O
asked	O
how	O
because	O
it	O
had	O
seemed	O
impossible	O
from	O
her	O
perspective.	O

She	O
never	O
took	O
interest	O
in	O
the	O
talk	O
and	O
asked	O
no	O
questions.	O

She	O
was	O
suddenly	O
interested	O
in	O
the	O
conversation.	O

She	O
was	O
calm	O
and	O
collected,	O
giving	O
off	O
no	O
signs	O
of	O
impatience	O
or	O
worry.	O

She	O
was	O
out	O
of	O
breath	O
and	O
looking	O
flustered	O
for	O
a	O
moment.	O

The	O
lady	O
was	O
anxious	O
because	O
she	O
was	O
in	O
love.	O

He	O
lowered	O
his	O
voice	O
to	O
a	O
whisper.	O

He	O
raised	B-METAPHOR
his	O
voice	O
so	O
high	B-METAPHOR
that	O
it	O
could	O
be	O
heard	O
for	O
miles	O
around.	O

He	O
raised	B-METAPHOR
his	O
voice.	O

His	O
name	O
was	O
not	O
Wade	O
but	O
instead,	O
Smith.	O

Julian	O
Wade	O
was	O
given	O
his	O
lordship	O
by	O
right	O
of	O
birth.	O

Lord	O
Julian	O
Wade	O
was	O
his	O
name.	O

He	O
completely	O
and	O
quite	O
clearly,	B-METAPHOR
understood	O
the	O
situation.	O

He	O
did	O
not	O
understand	O
the	O
circumstances	O
because	O
he	O
was	O
ignorant	O
of	O
all	O
the	O
facts.	O

I	O
do	O
not	O
believe	O
you	O
understand	O
the	O
entirety	O
of	O
the	O
situation.	O

She	O
had	O
told	O
him	O
that	O
she	O
was	O
pressured.	B-METAPHOR

She	O
was	O
feeling	O
relaxed,	O
as	O
she	O
relayed	O
to	O
him.	O

She	O
was	O
pressed	B-METAPHOR
because	O
she	O
had	O
many	O
deadlines	O
coming	O
soon.	O

Lord	O
Julian	O
got	O
off	O
the	O
Arabella	O
as	O
soon	O
as	O
he	O
possibly	O
could,	O
leaving	O
Miss	O
Bishop	O
alone.	O

Lord	O
Julian	O
stayed	O
on	O
the	O
Arabella	O
in	O
hopes	O
to	O
provide	O
Miss	O
Bishop	O
with	O
a	O
ride	O
free	O
from	O
interference.	O

Lord	O
Julian	O
was	O
very	O
interested	O
in	O
Miss	O
Bishop,	O
one	O
may	O
say	O
he	O
fancied	O
her.	O

He	O
spoke	O
and	O
Lord	O
Julian	O
raised	O
his	O
lion.	O

He	O
was	O
speaking	O
in	O
a	O
Russian	O
accent.	O

His	O
accents	O
were	O
unbelievable	O
when	O
he	O
spoke.	O

His	O
lordship	O
had	O
replied	O
after	O
a	O
little	O
bit	O
of	O
time.	O

The	O
lord	O
was	O
only	O
taking	O
his	O
time	O
because	O
he	O
needed	O
to	O
think	O
of	O
a	O
witty	O
response.	O

The	O
lordship	O
replied	O
immediately	O
and	O
only	O
figuratively.	O

Peter	O
is	O
hated	O
by	O
the	O
Bishop.	O

The	O
Bishop	O
and	O
Peter	O
are	O
lovers.	O

The	O
Bishop	O
hates	O
Peter	O
because	O
he	O
is	O
emotionally	O
unstable.	B-METAPHOR

All	O
the	O
questions	O
were	O
quickly	O
decided	O
on	O
and	O
a	O
resolution	O
was	O
quickly	O
created.	O

Ogle	O
had	O
many	O
concerns,	O
of	O
which	O
had	O
yet	O
to	O
be	O
satiated.	B-METAPHOR

Ogle	O
mentioned	O
that	O
the	O
people	O
asking	O
the	O
questions	O
did	O
not	O
know	O
what	O
they	O
were	O
talking	O
about.	O

Bishop	O
was	O
a	O
sinister	O
individual	O
with	O
no	O
mercy.	O

Pitt	O
did	O
not	O
say	O
anything	O
to	O
them.	O

Pitt	O
had	O
altered	O
the	O
other	O
that	O
they	O
would	O
likely	O
be	O
playing	B-METAPHOR
into	O
Bishop's	O
plans.	O

Captain	O
Blood	O
was	O
notoriously	O
good	O
at	O
promoting	O
morale.	O

He	O
looked	O
rather	O
sad	O
and	O
remained	O
quiet	O
beside	O
the	O
Captain.	O

He	O
shouted	O
in	O
shock	O
as	O
he	O
stooped	O
beside	O
the	O
Captain.	O

He	O
is	O
absolutely	O
neither	O
right	O
nor	O
wrong.	O

He	O
is	O
both	O
right	O
and	O
wrong.	O

He	O
might	O
be	O
right,	O
and	O
he	O
might	O
be	O
wrong.	O

He	O
had	O
acted	O
rather	O
terrible	O
to	O
her.	O

She	O
had	O
hidden	O
the	O
fact	O
that	O
she	O
may	O
have	O
resented	O
how	O
he	O
acted.	O

She	O
loved	O
the	O
words	O
in	O
which	O
he	O
spoke	O
to	O
her.	O

A	O
hundred	O
men	O
were	O
reportedly	O
on	O
the	O
frigate	O
that	O

yesterday	O
evening.	O

A	O

All	O
of	O
the	O

were	O
under	O

He	O
attempted	O
to	O
hide	B-METAPHOR
a	O
villainous	O
face	O
with	O
a	O
less	O
sinister	O
facade.	B-METAPHOR

He	O
had	O
nothing	O
to	O
hide	O
and	O
provided	O
an	O
appearance	O
that	O
was	O
genuine.	O

His	O
toxicity	O
came	O
from	O
a	O
painful	O
upbringing.	O

He	O
didn't	O
smile	O
at	O
all.	O

He	O
kept	O
his	O

he	O

a	O

The	O
Arabella	O
often	O
took	O
on	O
only	O
the	O

of	O

The	O
Arabella	O
was	O
no	O
where	O
to	O

in	O
the	O

it	O

He	O
gave	O
a	O

to	O
Lord	O

He	O
tossed	B-METAPHOR
it	O
to	O
Lord	O
Julian.	O

He	O
whirled	O
towards	O
Lord	O
Julian.	O

Good-evening	O
to	O
you,	O
he	O

He	O

He	O

He	O
was	O

His	O

Pitt	O

that	O

that	O
the	O

would	O

it	O
out	O
for	O

Blood	O
was	O
engaged	O
in	O
a	O
high-stakes	B-METAPHOR

He	O
had	O
given	O
off	O
a	O

something	O
about	O
a	O

I	O

They	O

the	O

knew	O
it	O

Each	O

two	O

No	O

The	O

they	O

The	O

I	O

She	O

She	O
was	O
good	O

with	B-METAPHOR
him,	I-METAPHOR
so	O
it	O
hurt	O
her	O
that	O
he	O

He	O
is	O

Sometimes,	O
you	O

he	O

You	O
are	O

he	O
said	O
with	O
a	O

He	O
had	O
made	O
fun	O
of	O
the	O
man.	O

The	O
gentleman	O
was	O

of	O
because	O
he	O

The	O

It	O

The	O

Captain	O

Captain	O

Captain	O

Ogle	O

Ogle	O
would	O
be	O
a	O
fool	O
if	O
he	O

to	O
pull	B-METAPHOR
on	O
the	O

He	O
had	O
a	O
profound	B-METAPHOR
desire	O
to	O

it.	O

He	O

chosen	O
to	O

it	O

it	O
being	O
off-putting	O
to	O
him.	O

He	O
was	O
certainly	O
going	O

made	O

Her	O
voice	O
provided	O
insight	O
on	O
her	O

She	O
was	O
worried	O
because	O
there	O
might	O

been	O
a	O

She	O
considered	O
hiding	O
in	O
either	O
one.	O

She	O
did	O
not	O
want	O
to	O
betray	O
one	O
so	O
she	O
hid	O
in	O
the	O

She	O
didn't	O

where	O
she	O
hid.	O

She	O
had	O

her	O

him.	O

She	O
had	O
screamed	O
out	O
rather	O
loudly	O
which	O
had	O
surprised	O
him.	O

She	O
shouted	O
because	O
the	O

was	O

Bishop	O
had	O
stains	O
of	O

all	O
over	O
himself,	O
as	O

approached	O
him.	O

Colonel	O

It	O
is	O

that	O

I	O

I	O

He	O

Captain	O
Blood	O
hastily	O
read	O
what	O
the	O
other	O
people	O
were	O
thinking.	O

Captain	O
Blood,	O
for	O
the	O
life	O
of	O
him,	O
could	O
not	O
figure	O
out	O
what	O
was	O
on	O
their	O

It	O
is	O
true	O
that	O
Captain	O

knew	O
how	O
to	O
read	B-METAPHOR
people	O
from	O
taking	O
Psychology	O
back	O

Colonel	O
Bishop	O
likely	O
did	O
not	O
have	O
anything	O
to	O

Colonel	O
Bishop	O
said	O
something	O
that	O
was	O
to	O
be	O
apprehended	O
with	O
utmost	O
disgust.	O

The	O
Bishop	O
was	O
supposed	O
to	O
apprehend	O
a	O
criminal.	O

He	O
never	O
questioned	O
whether	O
the	O
mischief	O
was	O
your	O
doing.	O

He	O
questioned	O
whether	O
or	O
not	O
if	O
the	O
mischievous	O
acts	O
were	O
caused	O
by	O
you.	O

The	O
source	B-METAPHOR
of	O
the	O
mischief	O
was	O
not	O
yours	O
alone.	O

He	O
had	O
approved	O
the	O
shrewd	O
advocacy.	O

He	O
most	O
certainly	O
did	O
not	O
approve	O
of	O
the	O
shrewd	O
advocacy.	O

He	O
only	O
approved	O
it	O
because	O
it	O
was	O
the	O
right	O
thing	O
to	O
do	O
at	O
the	O
time.	O

Julian	O
got	O
off	O
his	O

as	O

Remaining	O

Wolverstone	O
realized	O
that	O
it	O
was	O
impossible	O
for	O
them	O
to	O

Wolverstone	O
attempted	O

really	O

Wolverstone	O
let	B-METAPHOR

that	O

Even	O

think	O
that	O
he	O
over-does	O
his	O
chivalry.	O

He	O
certainly	O
goes	O
overboard	O
with	O
his	O
chivalry.	O

He	O
needs	O
to	O
learn	O
to	O
be	O
a	O
little	O
more	O
chivalrous.	O

He	O
aimed	O
his	O
telescope	O
at	O
the	O

in	O
the	O
morning.	O

He	O
aimed	O
his	O

He	O
broke	O

therefore	O
couldn't	O

I	O

Blood	O
was	O

was	O
very	O
intent	O
on	O

Blood,	O
without	O

asked	O
if	O

But	O
what	O
if	O
he	O

not?	O
asked	O

politely.	O

I	O
might	O

Though	O

she	O

to	O

one	O

An	O
