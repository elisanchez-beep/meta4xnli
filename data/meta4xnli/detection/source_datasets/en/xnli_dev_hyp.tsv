I	O

I	O
knew	O

what	O
I	O
needed	O
to	O
do	O
as	O
I	O
marched	O

Washington.	O

I	O
was	O
not	O

what	O
I	O

so	O
I	O
went	O
to	O

where	O
I	O
was	O

He	O

on.	O

When	O
I	O
said	O
yes,	O
we	O
decided	O
that	O
we	O

that	O

I	O
understood	O
it	O
well	O
from	O

I	O

I	O

I	O

I	O
made	O

the	O

That	O

He	O

What's	O
a	O

I	O

you	O
have	O

10	O

a	O

to	O
be	O

I	O

you	O

It's	O
fine	O
if	O
you	O
don't	O
really	O
take	O
it	O

I	O
just	O
know	O
it	O
will	O
be	O
so	O
boring	O
and	O
not	O
worth	O
changing	O
those	O
that	O
represent	O
us	O
so	O
we	O
should	O
not	O
even	O
try	O
to	O

I	O
think	O
it	O
will	O
be	O
challenging	B-METAPHOR
to	O
change	O
our	O

but	O
worthwhile	O
in	O
the	O

We	O
have	O
to	O
make	O
changes	O
to	O
those	O

They	O

they	O

it's	O
crazy	O
that	O
one	O

I	O
think	O
it's	O
nuts	O
that	O
it	O
can	O
last	O

It	O

I	O

a	O
great	O
morning!	O
It	O
was	O
nice	O
chatting	O
with	O
you	O
online.	O

I	O
think	O
I	O
know	O
why	O
I'm	O
not	O
well	O
but	O
I	O
do	O
not	O
want	O
to	O
tell	O
you.	O

I'm	O
not	O
certain	O
but	O
I'm	O
kinda	O
fine,	O
it	O
was	O
nice	O
to	O
speak	O
with	O
you	O
tonight.	O

Grand	O
Rapids	O
is	O
a	O
beautiful	O
place.	O

We	O
don't	O
have	O
a	O
son.	O

We	O
went	O
to	O
Grand	O
Rapids	O
to	O
see	O
our	O
son	O
graduate.	O

Did	O
you	O
attend	O
the	O
camp	O
about	O
wilderness?	O

Did	O
you	O
go	O
to	O
the	O
indoor	O
camp?	O

I	O
thought	O
you	O
went	O
to	O
the	O
camp.	O

It	O
is	O
slowly	O
getting	O
worse.	O

It	O
seems	O
to	O
be	O
getting	O
worse.	O

It's	O
getting	O
better.	O

Having	O
a	O
yard	O
is	O
not	O
all	O
fun	O
and	O
games	O
but	O
I	O
do	O
enjoy	O
it.	O

I	O
do	O
not	O
wish	O
to	O
lose	O
it	O
but	O
that	O
is	O
what	O
could	O
happen	O
when	O
you	O
own	O
a	O
yard.	O

When	O
you	O
own	O
your	O
own	O
piece	O
of	O
land	O
you	O
have	O
nothing	O
to	O
lose	O
anymore.	O

After	O
they	O
tell	O
you	O
what	O
to	O
do,	O
you	O
go	O
ahead	O
and	O
do	O
it	O
yourself.	O

They	O
don't	O
tell	O
you	O
how	O
to	O
do	O
it	O
at	O
all.	O

They	O
give	O
decent	O
instructions	O
on	O
how	O
to	O
go	O
about	O
it.	O

It	O
has	O
nothing	O
to	O
do	O
with	O
anyone	O
involved	O
in	O
the	O
legal	O
system.	O

It's	O
everyone	O
involved	O
in	O
the	O
legal	O
system.	O

Most	O
of	O
the	O
legal	O
system	O
is	O
involved,	O
a	O
majority	O
being	O
that	O
of	O
police.	O

At	O
the	O
time	O
that	O
I	O
became	O
a	O
member	O
there	O
was	O
at	O
least	O
twenty	O
five	O
hundred	O
individuals.	O

I	O
think	O
when	O
I	O
joined	O
there	O
was	O
at	O
least	O
a	O
few	O
people	O
that	O
I	O
knew.	O

There	O
is	O
only	O
at	O
the	O
most	O
one	O
hundred	O
people	O
that	O
ever	O
joined.	O

I	O
really	O
don't	O
even	O
know	O
what	O
I	O
would	O
pick.	O

I	O
would	O
choose	O
I'll	O
Fly	O
Away.	O

I'll	O
Fly	O
Away	O
is	O
my	O
favorite	O
movie	O
and	O
I	O
watch	O
it	O
weekly.	O

The	O
price	O
is	O
pretty	O
good.	O

We	O
are	O
definitely	O
going	O
to	O
get	O
it	O
to	O
watch	O
our	O
local	O
news.	O

We	O
don't	O
want	O
it	O
because	O
we	O
like	O
local	O
news	O
and	O
it	O
doesn't	O
get	O

Anderson	O
beat	B-METAPHOR
out	O
Reagan.	O

Anderson	O
ran	B-METAPHOR
against	O
Reagan	O
as	O
an	O
independent.	O

There	O
were	O
other	O
independent	O
tickets	O
that	O
ran	B-METAPHOR
as	O
well.	O

The	O
are	O
more	O
economical	O
because	O
they	O
are	O
really	O
good	O
on	O
gas.	O

The	O
gas	O
mileage	O
is	O
terrible	O
and	O
I'm	O
constantly	O
paying	O
for	O
gas.	O

They	O
are	O
also	O
the	O
best	O
looking	O

around.	O

A	O
couple	O
years	O
ago	O
I	O
studied	O
in	O
London	O
for	O
a	O
semester.	O

I	O
have	O
never	O
studied	O
abroad	O
before.	O

London	O
schools	O
are	O
the	O
best.	O

The	O
did	O
the	O
same	O
thing	O
as	O
everyone	O
else.	O

Their	O
way	B-METAPHOR
of	O
using	O
them	O
was	O
much	O
better.	O

They	O
did	O
things	O
with	O
them	O
a	O
little	O
differently.	O

I	O
am	O
not	O
able	O
to	O
use	O
the	O
cakes.	O

I	O
could	O
never	O
run	O
out	O
of	O
ideas	O
for	O
cake!	O

I	O
wish	O
I	O
could	O
do	O
something	O
with	O
the	O
cakes	O
but	O
I	O
have	O
no	O
use	O
for	O
them.	O

I	O
have	O
a	O
VCR	O
that	O
keeps	O
breaking.	O

My	O
VCR	O
works	O
perfectly.	O

The	O
VCR	O
only	O
works	O
for	O
about	O
a	O
week	O
and	O
then	O
it	O
is	O
broken	O
again.	O

I	O
really	O
didn't	O
like	O
the	O
seminar	O
that	O
was	O
done	O
by	O
satellite.	O

I	O
went	O
to	O
a	O
seminar	O
that	O
was	O
done	O
by	O
satellite.	O

There	O
were	O
a	O
lot	O
of	O
people	O
attending	O
the	O
satellite	O
seminar.	O

I	O
wish	O
that	O
this	O
did	O
not	O
have	O
to	O
happen	O
since	O
it	O
was	O
so	O
discouraging.	O

Yeah	O
it	O
made	O
it	O
without	O
a	O
single	O
scratch!	O

Yes	O
is	O
have	O
surely	O
gone	O
through	O
a	O
lot.	O

I	O
bet	B-METAPHOR
you	O
taught	O
yourself	O
how	O
to	O
do	O
that.	O

That	O
is	O
so	O
lame,	O
I	O
am	O
glad	O
you	O
dont	O
know	O
how	O
to	O
do	O
it.	O

Where	O
did	O
you	O
learn	O
how	O
to	O
do	O
that?	O

It	O
was	O
for	O
Father's	O
Day	O
and	O
Ellen	O
always	O
took	O
care	O
of	O
it.	O

Some	O
friends	O
celebrated	O
Mother's	O
Day.	O

Some	O
friends	O
took	O
turns	O
hosting	O
Mother's	O
Day	O
brunch.	O

Do	O
you	O
know	O
what	O
script	O
they're	O
going	O
to	O
give	O
us	O
to	O
read?	O

I	O
know	O
we	O
don't	O
have	O
a	O
clue	B-METAPHOR
what	O
we'll	O
say.	O

What	O
are	O
we	O
doing	O
to	O
say?	O

Everyone	O
takes	O
care	O
of	O
their	O
own	O
family,	O
no	O
matter	O
what.	O

Some	O
people	O
can't	O
care	O
for	O
elderly	O
relatives	O
because	O
their	O
homes	O
have	O
lots	O
of	O
stairs.	O

Some	O
people	O
can't	O
care	O
for	O
other	O

Let's	O

The	O

thing	O
I've	O
tried!	O

Their	O
lasagna	O
is	O
excellent.	O

Their	O
lasagna	O
is	O
great	O
because	O

It's	O

for	O

It's	O

their	O
kids	O
until	O
they	O
are	O
able	O
to	O
do	O
it	O
on	O

it.	O

I	O

it's	O

You	O

You	O

You	O

by	O
the	O

The	O

The	O

Lord	O

provided	O
a	O

Lord	O

welcomed	O

Though	O

him,	O

Wolverstone	O
had	O
asked	O
a	O
question	O
that	O
demonstrated	O
his	O
assertiveness	O
to	O
others.	O

Wolverstone	O
had	O
mentioned	O
the	O
Bishop	O
to	O
be	O
one	O
who	O
was	O
very	O
pretty.	O

Wolverstone	O
never	O
said	O
anything	O
about	O
the	O
Bishop.	O

Blood	O
had	O
a	O
hat	O
that	O
he	O
wore	O
before	O
sitting	O
down.	O

Blood	O
put	O
on	O
his	O
hat,	O
and	O
left	O
the	O
room	O
without	O

anything.	O

Blood's	O
hat	O
was	O
black,	O
with	O
three	O

on	O
it.	O

He	O
slept	O
soundly	B-METAPHOR
at	O
night	O
knowing	O
he	O
had	O
rejected	O
the	O
King's	O
commission.	O

Keeping	O
him	O
up	O
at	O
night	O
was	O
the	O
fact	O
that	O
he	O
accepted	O
the	O
King's	O
commission.	O

The	O
King's	O
commission	O
was	O
a	O
very	O
prestigious	O
title	O
with	O
many	O
responsibilities.	O

Ogle	O
said	O
that	O
they	O
were	O
reachable.	O

Ogle	O
said	O
that	O
they	O
were	O
within	O
earshot.	O

Though	O
he	O
knew	O
that	O
they	O
were	O
within	O
range,	O
Ogle	O
kept	O
it	O

I	O
have	O
not	O
heard	O
any	O
news,	O
Captain	O

Have	O
you?	O

I	O
received	O
some	O
news	O
before	O
sending	O
for	O
you,	O
Captain	O
Blood.	O

The	O
news	O
I	O
received	O
shocked	O
me	O
to	O
the	O
core.	B-METAPHOR

Her	O
composure	O
looked	O
unnatural	O
because	O
she	O
had	O
a	O
backache	O

She	O
didn't	O
ask	O
anything,	O
she	O
told	O
him	O
to	O
get	O
out.	O

She	O
was	O
dressed	O
in	O
white	O
when	O
she	O
asked:	O
Why	O
do	O
you	O
run,	O
then?.	O

Ogle	O
had	O
a	O
crew.	O

Ogle	O
let	O
him	O
continue	O
to	O
speak.	O

Ogle	O
was	O
angry.	O

He	O
has	O
never	O
imagined	O
grasping	B-METAPHOR
me.	O

He	O
thinks	O
grabbing	B-METAPHOR
me	O
will	O
be	O
really	O
simple.	O

I	O
may	O
not	O
be	O
as	O
easy	O
to	O
grab	B-METAPHOR
as	O
he	O
thinks.	O

I	O
accept	O
it	O
willingly.	O

I	O
am	O
not	O
willing	O
to	O
accept	O
it,	O
but	O
I	O
could	O
be	O
convinced.	O

I	O
don't	O
accept	O
it	O
willingly.	O

After	O
a	O
pause	O
he	O
said	O
a	O
murderer,	O
I.	O

He	O
hadn't	O
murdered	O
anyone.	O

Immediately	O
he	O
said,	O
A	O
murderer,	O
I.	O

He	O
had	O
a	O
beard	O
that	O
was	O
a	O
gold	O
color.	O

He	O
had	O
been	O
growing	O
his	O
beard	O
for	O
years.	O

His	O
face	O
was	O
clean-shaven.	O

The	O
woman	O
had	O
had	O
enough	O
of	O
their	O
bad	O
behavior.	O

The	O
woman	O
was	O
angry	O
and	O
defensive.	O

The	O
woman	O
was	O
so	O
delighted	O
that	O
she	O
was	O
speechless!	O

He	O
did	O
not	O
ask	O
any	O
questions,	O
since	O
he	O
knew	O
he	O
had	O
picked	O
the	O
best	O
way.	B-METAPHOR

He	O
wanted	O
to	O
know	O
if	O
there	O
was	O
a	O
better	O
way.	B-METAPHOR

He	O
was	O
convinced	O
that	O
he	O
had	O
chosen	O
the	O
best	O
way.	B-METAPHOR

He	O
rose	O
promptly,	O
and	O
proceeded	O
to	O
pull	O
Lord	O
Julian	O
up	O
to	O
his	O
feet.	O

He	O
was	O
feeling	O
very	O
tired,	O
so	O
he	O
did	O
not	O
stand	O
up.	O

Lord	O
Julian	O
rose,	O
showing	O
good	O
manners,	O
but	O
he	O
did	O
not	O
bother	O
standing.	O

He	O
let	B-METAPHOR
out	I-METAPHOR
a	O
sign	O
of	O
resignation.	O

He	O
remained	O
silent	O
as	O
he	O
complained	O
about	O
the	O
simplicity	O
of	O
life.	O

Life	O
is	O
infernally	B-METAPHOR
complicated	O
because	O
of	O
the	O
many	O
interactions	O
one	O
might	O
have.	O

Colonel	O
Bishop	O
has	O
done	O
something	O
to	O
make	O
Wolverstone	O
his	O
enemy.	O

He	O
spit	O
on	O
the	O
ground	O
in	O
an	O
effort	O
to	O
emphasize	O
his	O
point.	O

Wolverstone	O
and	O
Colonel	O
Bishop	O
were	O
close	O
friends.	O

Calverly	O
responded	O
in	O
a	O
way	B-METAPHOR
that	O
made	O
him	O
seem	O
like	O
he	O
was	O
on-the-fence	O
about	O
something.	O

Calverly	O
was	O
only	O
indecisive	O
in	O
his	O
answer	O
because	O
he	O
did	O
not	O
know	O
all	O
of	O
the	O
facts.	O

Cleverly	O
spoke	O
with	O
clear	B-METAPHOR
decisiveness,	O
knowing	O
that	O
he	O
has	O
with	O
certainty.	O

He	O
has	O
his	O
own	O
officers.	O

He	O
is	O
alone	O
and	O
has	O
no	O
officers.	O

His	O
officers	O
respect	O
him.	O

She	O
did	O
not	O
want	O
him	O
to	O
help	O
her,	O
though	O
was	O
grateful	O
anyway.	O

She	O
had	O
told	O
him	O
that	O
resolve	O
was	O
what	O
it	O
took	O
to	O
keep	B-METAPHOR
her	O
away	I-METAPHOR
from	O
peril.	O

The	O
resolve	O
did	O
not	O
protect	O
her	O
at	O
all	O
from	O
any	O
dangers.	O

It	O
is	O
a	O
distinguished	O
and	O
eminent	O
service.	O

It	O
is	O
an	O
honorable	O
service	O
because	O
it's	O
about	O
saving	O
lives.	O

It	O
isn't	O
an	O
honorable	O
service	O
at	O
all,	O
it's	O
very	O
embarrassing!	O

The	O
man	O
is	O
acting	O
uncivilized.	O

The	O
man	O
is	O
calm	O
and	O
reasonable.	O

They	O
are	O

a	O

He	O
had	O
heard	O
some	O
exciting	O
news.	O

He	O
was	O
looking	O
away	O
from	O
the	O
Captain	O
and	O
then	O
turned	O
around	O
to	O
see	O
him.	O

The	O
Captain	O
was	O
angry.	O

He	O
kept	O
his	O
eyes	O
down	O
looking	O
at	O
the	O
ground.	O

He	O
was	O
surprised	O
by	O
her.	O

She	O
was	O
braver	O
than	O
he	O
expected.	O

Pitt	O
completely	O

the	O

He	O

He	O
spent	B-METAPHOR
2	O

in	O

He	O
was	O
doing	O

on	O

The	O

It	O

The	O

There	O

in	O

The	O

Miss	O

went	O
to	O

There	O

She	O
quickly	O
fled	O
the	O

in	O
order	O
to	O
avoid	O

scrutiny.	O

The	O
fact	O
that	O
she	O
was	O
here	O
after	O
the	O

with	O
Wolverstone	O
was	O
considered	O
an	O
embarrassment.	O

Wolverstone	O
never	O
got	O
into	O
a	O

with	O

He	O
had	O
suddenly	O
asked	O
a	O

as	O
to	O
who	O
you	O
may	O
be.	O

He	O
quietly	O
murmured	O
to	O
himself	O
the	O
whole	O
time.	O

The	O
person	O
was	O
actually	O
the	O

himself.	O

As	O

The	O

both	O

As	O
he	O
is	O
experienced,	O
Captain	O
Blood	O
helped	O
boost	B-METAPHOR
morale	O
amongst	O
his	O
crew	O
members.	O

Captain	O
Blood	O
yelled	O
to	O
Old	O
Wolf.	O

Let	O
go!	O
Captain	O
Blood	O
yelled	O
to	O
Old	O
Wolf.	O

He	O
has	O
only	O
one	O
eye.	O

He	O
has	O
three	O
eyes.	O

He	O
only	O
has	O
a	O

The	O
blood	O
came	O
from	O
a	O
person's	O
eye	O
as	O
they	O
had	O
looked	O
into	O
the	O
telescope.	O

There	O
was	O
blood	O
around	O
the	O

There	O
was	O
no	O
sign	O
of	O

anywhere	O

The	O

The	O

I	O
want	O
you	O
to	O
explain	O
yourself!	O
I	O
know	O
you	O
know	O
where	O
Wolverstone	O
is.	O

Wolverstone	O
is	O
right	O
here.	O
No	O

You	O
should	O
explain	O
yourself!	O
What	O
happened	O
to	O
Wolverstone?	O

Ogle	O
had	O
attempted	O
to	O
give	O
orders	O
as	O
though	O
he	O
were	O
the	O
Captain.	O

The	O
Captain	O
of	O
the	O
ship	O
was	O
feeling	O
rather	O
ill.	O

There	O
was	O
no	O
one	O
on	O
the	O
ship	O
to	O
give	O
orders.	O

The	O
ship	O
will	O
sink	O
unless	O
the	O
crew	O
acts	O
fast.	O

There	O
is	O
a	O
way	B-METAPHOR
for	O
them	O
to	O
sink.	O

They	O
can	O
not	O
possibly	O
sink	O
in	O
any	O
circumstance.	O

The	O
Wolverstone	O
completely	O
haulted.	O

The	O
Wolverstone	O
did	O
not	O
come	O
to	O
an	O
end.	O

The	O
Wolverstone	O
was	O
part	O
of	O
an	O
elaborate	O
ploy.	O

He	O
never	O
desired	O
to	O
be	O
anything	O
like	O
that	O
dog	O
in	O
that	O
one	O
fable.	O

The	O
fable	O
is	O
as	O
old	O
as	O
time.	O

There	O
was	O
once	O
a	O
story	O
about	O
a	O
dog	O
and	O
a	O
delusive	B-METAPHOR
shadow.	B-METAPHOR

There	O
might	O
have	O
been	O
an	O
error	O
to	O
give	O
Captain	O
Blood	O
his	O
commission.	O

There	O
was	O
no	O
mistake	O
in	O
providing	O
Captain	O
Blood	O
with	O
his	O
commission.	O

There	O
was	O
the	O
potential	O
for	O
error	O
as	O
the	O
accountant	O
was	O
recently	O
fired.	O

He	O
had	O
moved	O
his	O
shoulders	O
in	O
a	O
sign	O
of	O
acceptance.	O

He	O
told	O
them	O
that	O
he	O
could	O
see	O
it	O
but	O
it	O
was	O
not	O
a	O
big	B-METAPHOR
deal	O
in	O
the	O
end.	O

It	O
was	O
clear	B-METAPHOR
that	O
staying	O
could	O
have	O
helped	O
me,	O
so	O
no	O
question	O
was	O
ever	O
posed.	O

He	O
wants	O
to	O
see	O
you	O
about	O
the	O
Old	O
Bear	O
and	O
not	O
about	O
the	O
Old	O
Wolf.	O

He	O
wants	O
to	O
see	O
you	O
about	O
the	O
Old	O

He	O
wants	O

see	O

His	O
choice	O
was	O
between	O
buying	O
12	O
chickens	O
or	O
3	O
oxen.	O

His	O
lordship	O
believed	O
that	O
either	O
choice	O
would	O
have	O
had	O
a	O
substantial	O
impact.	B-METAPHOR

Whether	O
or	O
not	O
he	O
chose	O
to	O
act,	O
his	O
lordship	O
did	O
not	O
believe	O
it	O
would	O
have	O
changed	O
anything.	O

He	O
did	O
not	O
like	O
what	O
you	O
said.	O

He	O
is	O
going	O
to	O
punish	O
you	O
for	O
those	O
words.	O

He	O
really	O
enjoyed	O
what	O
you	O
said.	O

He	O
was	O
wrong	O
and	O
she	O
said	O
nothing.	O

She	O
fixed	B-METAPHOR
his	O
issue.	O

She	O
was	O
always	O
tasked	O
with	O
correcting	O
him.	O

Julian	O
looked	O
serious	O
but	O
was	O
actually	O
amused.	O

Julian	O
thought	O
the	O
situation	O
was	O
funny.	O

Julian	O
was	O
being	O
clear	B-METAPHOR
about	O
his	O
feelings.	O

The	O
lordship	O
just	O
took	B-METAPHOR
my	O
advice	O
and	O
carried	O
his	O
acts	O
accordingly.	O

While	O
the	O
lordship	O
was	O
very	O
smart,	O
his	O
grave	B-METAPHOR
mistake	O
of	O
not	O
listening	O
to	O
my	O
counsel	O
will	O
spell	O
the	O
end	O
of	O
the	O
kingdom.	O

Your	O
lordship	O
has	O
chosen	O
to	O
act	O
in	O
a	O
manner	O
against	O
my	O
advice.	O

He	O
asked	O
because	O
he	O
was	O
rather	O
shocked	O
about	O
the	O
whole	O
situation.	O

He	O
had	O
shouted	O
a	O
question.	O

He	O
never	O
posed	O
a	O
question	O
as	O
he	O
remained	O
silent.	O

People	O
from	O
the	O
forecastle	O
were	O
joining	O
the	O
men	O
in	O
the	O
waist.	O

Some	O
people	O
believed	O
the	O
tale	O
that	O
the	O
princess	O
had	O
been	O
eaten	O
by	O
a	O
dragon.	O

The	O
ranks	O
of	O
men	O
were	O
dwindling,	O
as	O
everyone	O
headed	O
towards	O
the	O
forecastle	O
for	O
dinner.	O

It	O
decreased	O
his	O
excitement.	O

It	O
made	O
him	O
more	O
excited	O
than	O
he	O
had	O
ever	O
been.	O

It	O
made	O
him	O
more	O
excited.	O

There	O
was	O
no	O
way	B-METAPHOR
of	O
knowing	O
if	O
the	O
boat	O
would	O
still	O
move	O
forward.	O

There	O
was	O
nothing	O
able	O
to	O
slow	O
down	O
the	O

We	O

Blood	O

to	O
the	O

he	O

Blood	O
wished	O
the	O

His	O
Majesty's	O
Deputy-Governer	O
of	O
Jamaica	O
is	O
already	O
dead.	O

One	O
man	O
told	O
the	O
other	O
that	O
he	O
had	O
done	O
his	O
work	O
perfectly	O
and	O
that	O
any	O
mistakes	O
were	O
his	O
own	O
fault.	O

I	O
was	O
expecting	O
your	O
arrival	O
said	O
the	O
Deputy-Governor.	O

The	O
Deputy-Governor	O
was	O
not	O
necessarily	O
expecting	O
him,	O
though	O
greeted	O
him	O
anyways.	O

There	O
was	O
some	O
remorse	O
when	O
the	O
Deputy-Governor	O
had	O
waved	O
hello.	O

He	O
didn't	O
have	O
any	O
arms	O
so	O
he	O
asked	O
someone	O
else	O
to	O
point	O
to	O
the	O
girl.	O

He	O
pointed	O
at	O
the	O
girl.	O

The	O
girl	O
had	O
blonde	O
hair.	O

Ogle	O
never	O
mentioned	O
anyone	O
who	O
disliked	O
the	O
current	O
course.	O

Some	O
did	O
not	O
like	O
the	O
idea	O
of	O
the	O
current	O
course	O
and	O
refuted	O
it,	O
explicitly.	O

The	O
course	O
was	O
full	O
of	O
territory	O
that	O
was	O
left	O
unexplored	O
and	O
was,	O
therefore,	O
very	O
dangerous.	O

It	O
doesn't	O
matter	O
what	O
I	O
think	O
of	O
you.	O

You	O
might	O
care	O
what	O
I	O
think	O
about	O
you.	O

You	O
should	O
definitely	O
care	O
about	O
what	O
I	O
think	O
of	O
you.	O

As	O
many	O
said	O
before,	O
Wolverstone	O
was	O
a	O
simple	O
man	O
with	O
few	O
words.	O

I	O
felt	O
very	O
bubbled	B-METAPHOR
by	O
the	O
words	O
of	O
Wolverstone.	O

Wolverstone	O
had	O
said	O
something	O
that	O
did	O
not	O
make	O
one	O
feel	O
bubbled.	B-METAPHOR

The	O
night	O
was	O
considered	O
restful	O
though,	O
there	O
was	O
a	O
lot	O
of	O
commotion	B-METAPHOR
later	O
on.	O

The	O
night	O
was	O
extremely	O
busy	O
as	O
the	O
streets	O
were	O
packed	B-METAPHOR
with	O
people.	O

This	O
evening	O
was	O
busier	O
than	O
usual	O
because	O
of	O
an	O
event	O
being	O
hosted.	O

Encouraging	O
this,	O
she	O
had	O
found	O
many	O
reasons	O
as	O
to	O
why	O
one	O
would	O
trouble	O
themselves	O
to	O
defend	O
you.	O

She	O
had	O
discouraged	O
any	O
form	O
of	O
defense	O
that	O
was	O
applicable	O
to	O
you.	O

The	O
defense	O
that	O
was	O
put	O
forth	O
by	O
her	O
was	O
insufficient.	O

He	O
spoke	O
with	O
a	O
soft	B-METAPHOR
tone.	O

Jeremy	O
shouted	O
very	O
loudly	O
to	O
get	O
their	O
attention.	O

Jeremy	O
was	O
a	O

for	O
his	O

Are	O
you	O

He	O
asked.	O

He	O
begged.	O

Why	O
are	O
you	O
not	O
leaving	O
right	O
now?	O
He	O
grunted.	O

He	O
found	O
little	O
safety	O
through	O
reading	O
the	O
passage	O
on	O
the	O

I	O

that	O
I	O

with	O

before.	O

I	O
completely	O
