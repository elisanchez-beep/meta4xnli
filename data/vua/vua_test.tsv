collapsed	B-METAPHOR

‘	O
It	O
was	O
about	O
8.30am	O
and	O
I	O
was	O
just	O
getting	O
dressed	O
when	O
it	O
came	B-METAPHOR
over	O
on	O
the	O
news	O

Mr	O

a	O
former	O
clerk	O
of	O
works	O
at	O
Harrow	O

London	O

Investors	O
in	O
Barlow	O
Clowes	O
since	O
1985	O
,	O
the	O
Tysons	O
had	O
orginally	O
put	B-METAPHOR
£10,000	O
into	O
the	O
UK	O

and	O
£5,000	O
in	O
Gibraltar-based	O
Barlow	O
Clowes	O
International	O
(	O
BCI	O
)	O
.	O

Fate	O
determined	O
that	O
a	O
short	B-METAPHOR
while	O
before	O
the	O
businesses	O
failed	B-METAPHOR
,	O
they	O
transferred	B-METAPHOR
the	O
£10,000	O
to	O
BCI	O
because	O
of	O
the	O
better	O
returns	B-METAPHOR
being	O
offered	O
.	O

In	O
the	O
days	O
that	O
followed	B-METAPHOR
,	O
the	O
Tysons	O
found	B-METAPHOR
that	O
they	O
and	O
18,000	O
other	O
investors	O
had	O
been	O
the	O
victims	B-METAPHOR
of	O
a	O
financial	O
crash	B-METAPHOR
of	O
global	O
proportions	O
.	O

Of	O
the	O
£190million	O
invested	O
in	O
both	O
funds	O
,	O
BCI	O
investors	O
faced	B-METAPHOR
a	O
shortfall	O
of	O
up	O
to	O
£100million	O
.	O

After	O
the	O
initial	O
shock	B-METAPHOR
and	O
disbelief	O
,	O
the	O
Tysons	O
grew	O
angry	O
—	O
at	O
the	O
advisers	O
who	O
convinced	O
them	O
about	O
Barlow	O
Clowes	O
,	O
at	O
the	O
Midland	O
bank	O
manager	O
who	O
gave	B-METAPHOR
verbal	O
assurances	O
of	O
its	O
security	B-METAPHOR
,	O
at	O
the	O
regulatory	O
authorities	O
responsible	B-METAPHOR
for	O
the	O
investment	O
community	B-METAPHOR
and	O
at	O
the	O
Department	O
of	O
Trade	O
and	O
Industry	O
which	O
allowed	B-METAPHOR
the	O
company	O
to	O
trade	O
.	O

‘	O
I	O
felt	B-METAPHOR
it	O
was	O
so	O
safe	B-METAPHOR
,	O
they	O
were	O
so	O
professional	O
,	O
’	O
said	O
Mr	O
Tyson	O
.	O

‘	O
I	O
feel	B-METAPHOR
appalled	O
by	O
the	O
way	B-METAPHOR
these	O
professional	O
guardians	O
have	O
treated	O
us	O
.	O

If	O
you	O
were	O
a	O
gambling	B-METAPHOR
man	O
it	O
would	O
not	O
affect	O
you	O
,	O
it	O
would	O
just	O
be	O

But	O
this	O
was	O
not	O
a	O
gamble	B-METAPHOR
.	O
’	O

Like	O
so	O
many	O
investors	O
,	O
Mr	O
Tyson	O
found	B-METAPHOR
himself	O
having	O
to	O
go	O
back	O
to	O
work	O
to	O
ease	B-METAPHOR
the	O
financial	O
strain	B-METAPHOR
he	O
had	O
hoped	O
to	O
avoid	B-METAPHOR
.	O

Ironically	O
,	O
it	O
was	O
the	O
Government	O
which	O
he	O
partly	O
blamed	O
for	O
the	O
affair	O
that	O
gave	B-METAPHOR
him	O
the	O
chance	O
to	O
return	B-METAPHOR
to	O
work	O
after	O
retirement	O
.	O

A	O
change	O
in	O
the	O
tax	O
rules	O
affecting	O
pensions	O
was	O
shortly	O
followed	B-METAPHOR
by	O
a	O
job	O
with	O
the	O
Department	O
of	O
Environment	O
's	O
Property	O
Services	O
Agency	O
,	O
a	O
post	O
which	O
carries	O
him	O
through	O

March	O
and	O
may	O
see	B-METAPHOR
him	O
stay	B-METAPHOR
until	O
he	O
is	O
70	O
.	O

Putting	B-METAPHOR
it	O
as	O
politely	O
as	O
he	O
can	O
,	O
Mr	O
Tyson	O
said	O
the	O
whole	B-METAPHOR
affair	O
‘	O
encouraged	B-METAPHOR
’	O
him	O
to	O
return	B-METAPHOR
to	O
paid	O
employment	O

‘	O
I	O
had	O
n't	O
planned	B-METAPHOR
to	O
work	O

all	O

’	O

And	O
like	O
all	O
of	O
the	O
other	O
investors	O
,	O
he	O
and	O
his	O
wife	O
were	O
in	O
a	O
quandry	O
.	O

They	O
wanted	O
to	O
do	O
something	O
but	O
felt	B-METAPHOR
powerless	O
.	O

Pursuing	B-METAPHOR
legal	O
action	O
would	O
have	O
cost	O
them	O
money	O
they	O
did	O
n't	O
have	O
(	O
unless	O
it	O
meant	B-METAPHOR
selling	O
their	O
house	O
which	O
was	O
not	O
an	O
option	O
)	O
but	O
doing	O
nothing	O
left	B-METAPHOR
them	O
with	O
the	O
feeling	B-METAPHOR
that	O
justice	O
was	O
n't	O
being	O
done	O
.	O

So	O
they	O
compromised	O
and	O
gave	O
£100	O
to	O
the	O
Barlow	O
Clowes	O
Investors	O
Group	O
which	O
was	O
formed	B-METAPHOR
last	O
July	O
to	O
represent	B-METAPHOR
the	O

and	O
co-ordinate	B-METAPHOR

That	O
,	O
says	O
Mr	O

has	O
been	O
their	O
only	O

This	O
chapter	O
will	O
examine	B-METAPHOR
a	O
range	B-METAPHOR
of	O
theories	O
which	O
attempt	B-METAPHOR
to	O
explain	O
such	O
behaviour	O

Although	O
the	O
major	O
theoretical	O
explanations	O
are	O
covered	B-METAPHOR
in	O
the	O
numerous	O
introductions	B-METAPHOR
to	O
the	O
sociology	O
of	O

deviance	O
and	O
to	O
sociology	O
generally	O
,	O
some	O
review	O
of	O
these	O

is	O
necessary	O
before	O
embarking	B-METAPHOR
upon	O
an	O
examination	O
of	O
specific	O
,	O
substantive	O
examples	O
of	O

As	O
this	O

what	O
follows	B-METAPHOR
will	O
be	O
a	O
brief	B-METAPHOR
overview	O
of	O
a	O
wide	B-METAPHOR
range	B-METAPHOR
of	O
theories	O
and	O
explanations	O

First	O
,	O
a	O
word	O
of	O
warning	O
might	O
be	O
in	O
order	B-METAPHOR
.	O

It	O
would	O
be	O
naive	O
to	O
expect	O
to	O
uncover	B-METAPHOR
any	O
ultimate	O
explanation	O
or	O
basic	O
cause	O
for	O
criminal	O
behaviour	O
,	O
given	O
the	O
extensive	B-METAPHOR
and	O
diverse	O
behaviour	O
that	O
is	O
encompassed	B-METAPHOR
by	O
the	O
term	O
crime	O
.	O

Suppose	O
,	O
for	O
example	O
,	O
that	O
it	O
could	O
be	O
proved	O
that	O
one	O
cause	O
of	O
delinquency	O
was	O
lack	O
of	O
parental	O
supervision	O
.	O

It	O
might	O
still	O
be	O
necessary	O
to	O
ask	O
why	O
delinquency	O
occurred	O
with	O
one	O
son	O
or	O
daughter	O
but	O
not	O
another	O
.	O

Also	O
,	O
there	O
would	O
be	O
the	O
further	O
question	O
of	O
why	O
the	O
parents	O
had	O
not	O
provided	O
adequate	O
supervision	O
.	O

Perhaps	O
this	O
was	O
because	O
of	O
their	O
poor	B-METAPHOR
living	O
conditions	O
which	O
would	O
raise	B-METAPHOR
the	O
question	O
of	O
why	O
they	O
were	O
in	O
poor	B-METAPHOR
housing	O
.	O

Was	O
this	O
because	O
of	O
governmental	O
housing	O
policy	O
or	O
a	O
poor	B-METAPHOR
employment	O
record	O
on	O
the	O
part	O
of	O
the	O
bread-winner	O
of	O
the	O
family	O
?	O

Clearly	B-METAPHOR
,	O
we	O
are	O
getting	B-METAPHOR
further	O
and	O
further	O
away	B-METAPHOR
from	O
the	O
causes	O
of	O
delinquent	O
behaviour	O
,	O
and	O
it	O
is	O
perhaps	O
wisest	O
to	O
think	O
in	O
terms	O
of	O
causal	O
processes	O
when	O
looking	B-METAPHOR
at	O
criminal	O
behaviour	O

Biological	O
and	O
psychological	O
theories	O

Before	O
examining	O
the	O
major	O
sociological	O
on	O

,	O
it	O
is	O
useful	O
to	O
refer	O
to	O
theories	O
from	O
outside	B-METAPHOR
of	O

,	O
from	O
other	O

Thus	O
,	O
we	O
will	O
look	B-METAPHOR
initially	O
at	O
biological	O
and	O
psychological	O
theories	O
.	O

Biological	O
theories	O

Biological	O
(	O
or	O
physiological	O
)	O
explanations	O
are	O
based	B-METAPHOR
on	O
the	O
notion	O
that	O
some	O
individuals	O
are	O
predisposed	O
to	O
criminal	O
behaviour	O
because	O
of	O
their	O
genetic	O
make-up	B-METAPHOR
.	O

The	O
individual	O
criminal	O
is	O
born	O
so	O
;	O
and	O
this	O
is	O
usually	O
put	B-METAPHOR
down	O
to	O
‘	O
faulty	O

’	O
,	O
or	O
,	O
more	O
vaguely	O
,	O
to	O
‘	O
hereditary	B-METAPHOR
traits	O
’	O
.	O

The	O
most	O
famous	O
exponent	O
of	O
this	O
approach	B-METAPHOR
was	O
the	O
nineteenth-century	O
Italian	O
physician	O
,	O
Cesare	O
Lombroso	O
.	O

In	O
his	O
book	O
L'Uomo	O
Delinquente	O
,	O
Lombroso	O
developed	O
a	O
complex	O
description	O
of	O
what	O
he	O
called	B-METAPHOR
the	O
‘	O
born	O
criminal	O
’	O
,	O
who	O
could	O
be	O
recognised	O
by	O
a	O
variety	O
of	O
physical	O
characteristics	O

in	O
particular	O

—	O
for	O

In	O

These	O
explanations	O
see	B-METAPHOR
the	O

as	O
inherently	O
more	O
prone	B-METAPHOR
to	O
criminal	O
behaviour	O
than	O
the	O

They	O
have	O
been	O
widely	O

rejected	O
by	O

Lombroso	O
's	O
work	O

for	O

was	O
based	B-METAPHOR
on	O
his	O
examination	O
of	O

This	O
would	O

the	O
fact	O
that	O
many	O

and	O
that	O

Most	O

not	O

Sheldon	O

found	B-METAPHOR
that	O

However	O

an	O

An	O
example	O
of	O
this	O
more	O
sophisticated	B-METAPHOR
biological	O
approach	B-METAPHOR
is	O
the	O
work	O
of	O
Hans	O
Eysenck	O
,	O
who	O
has	O
argued	O
in	O
a	O
series	O
of	O
studies	O
,	O
that	O
there	O
is	O
a	O
link	B-METAPHOR
between	O
genetically	O
based	O
personality	O
characteristics	O
and	O
criminal	O
behaviour	O
.	O

He	O
maintains	B-METAPHOR
that	O
there	O
is	O
a	O
link	B-METAPHOR
between	O
characteristics	O
such	O
as	O
extroversion	O
and	O
criminal	O

An	O
individual	O
's	O
degree	B-METAPHOR

inherited	B-METAPHOR
,	O
determined	B-METAPHOR
by	O
his	O
or	O
her	O
genetic	O
make-up	B-METAPHOR
.	O

The	O
link	B-METAPHOR
with	O
crime	O
found	B-METAPHOR
by	O
Eysenck	O
was	O
that	O
when	O
prisoners	O
were	O
tested	O
for	O
extroversion	O
,	O
more	O
extroverts	O
were	O
found	B-METAPHOR
than	O
in	O
the	O
general	O
population	O
.	O

Eysenck	O
then	O
argues	O
that	O
extroversion	O
is	O
the	O
inherited	B-METAPHOR
basis	O
of	O
criminal	O
behaviour	O
.	O

Extroverts	O
take	B-METAPHOR
longer	O
to	O
learn	O
the	O
rules	B-METAPHOR
of	O
society	O
,	O
they	O
are	O
more	O
likely	O
to	O
break	B-METAPHOR
them	O

and	O
thus	O
more	O
likely	O
become	O

suggesting	B-METAPHOR
a	O
link	B-METAPHOR
between	O

is	O
the	O
difficulty	O

While	O

what	O

Psychological	O

share	B-METAPHOR
certain	O

Psychological	O

of	O

Thus	O

with	O

the	O

of	O

We	O

do	O
justice	O
to	O
the	O

scope	O
of	O

here	O

but	O
there	O
are	O
some	O
basic	O
ideas	O
and	O
assumptions	O
which	O
underlie	O
such	O
theorizing	O

These	O
stress	B-METAPHOR
the	O
importance	O
of	O
family	O
relationships	O
and	O
upbringing	O
during	O
the	O
early	O
years	O
,	O
and	O
conclude	B-METAPHOR
that	O
anti-social	O
,	O
and	O
by	O
implication	O
criminal	O
,	O
behaviour	O
results	O
from	O
faulty	O
personality	O
development	O
.	O

To	O
summarise	O
,	O
these	O
biological	O
and	O
psychological	O
theories	O
hold	B-METAPHOR
that	O
the	O
criminal	O
is	O
a	O
particular	O
type	O
of	O
person	O
,	O
apart	O
from	O
the	O
rest	B-METAPHOR
of	O
society	O
and	O
with	O
a	O
special	O
predisposition	O
toward	O
criminal	O
behaviour	O
.	O

They	O
are	O
based	B-METAPHOR
on	O
the	O
idea	O
that	O
criminal	O
behaviour	O
is	O
either	O
inherited	B-METAPHOR
or	O
a	O
consequence	O
of	O
unique	O
,	O
individual	O
experiences	O
.	O

Before	O
we	O
look	B-METAPHOR
at	O
sociological	O
explanations	O
it	O
might	O
be	O
useful	O
to	O
ask	O
yourself	O
,	O
or	O
to	O
discuss	O
with	O
colleagues	O
,	O
whether	O
you	O
feel	B-METAPHOR
that	O
criminals	O
are	O
different	O
‘	O
types	O
’	O
of	O
person	O

While	O
there	O
are	O
,	O
no	O
doubt	O
,	O
predispositions	O
toward	O
criminal	O
behaviour	O
,	O
and	O
clearly	O
certain	O
characteristics	O
are	O
inherited	B-METAPHOR
,	O
most	O
sociologists	O
would	O
reject	O
these	O
‘	O
individual	O
pathology	O
’	O
sort	O
of	O
theories	O
.	O

They	O
lack	O
convincing	O
supporting	B-METAPHOR
evidence	O
.	O

While	O
some	O
offenders	O
suffer	O
from	O
mental	O
disorders	O
the	O
vast	B-METAPHOR
majority	O
do	O
not	O
.	O

Furthermore	O
,	O
if	O
criminals	O
are	O
abnormal	O
then	O
it	O
follows	B-METAPHOR
that	O
a	O
large	B-METAPHOR
proportion	O
of	O
the	O
population	O
must	O
also	O
be	O
abnormal	O
.	O

For	O
numerous	O
studies	O
have	O
shown	B-METAPHOR
that	O
a	O
high	B-METAPHOR
percentage	O
of	O
the	O
population	O
have	O
committed	O
criminal	O
offences	O
,	O
in	O
particular	O
high	B-METAPHOR
proportions	O
of	O
juveniles	O
,	O
and	O
it	O
is	O
difficult	O
to	O
believe	O
that	O
they	O
are	O
all	O
different	O
or	O
abnormal	O

Sociological	O
theories	O

We	O
said	O
above	O
that	O
sociologists	O
would	O
reject	O
non-sociological	O
explanations	O
of	O
crime	O
.	O

This	O
is	O
not	O
because	O
such	O
explanations	O
are	O
‘	O
wrong	O
’	O
,	O
but	O
because	O
they	O
are	O
incomplete	B-METAPHOR

inadequate	O

In	O
Chapter	O
One	O
,	O
it	O
was	O
stressed	B-METAPHOR
that	O
crime	O
can	O
not	O
be	O
considered	B-METAPHOR
aside	O
from	O
its	O
social	O
context	B-METAPHOR
,	O
that	O
it	O
is	O
dependent	O
on	O

the	O
first	O
thing	B-METAPHOR
she	O

to	O

on	O

On	O
her	O

Madame	O

took	O
her	O
to	O
Vidal	O

that	O
her	O

The	O

the	O

asked	O
me	O

I	O
had	O
nothing	O
particular	O
planned	B-METAPHOR

merely	O
an	O
idea	O
that	O
it	O
might	O
be	O
interesting	O

out	O

I	O
reckoned	B-METAPHOR

a	O
few	O

out	O

shake	B-METAPHOR

down	O

I	O
explained	O
all	O
that	O
to	O
Chatterton	O

stressed	B-METAPHOR
that	O

run	B-METAPHOR
for	O

at	O
the	O

Introduction	B-METAPHOR

In	O
recent	O
years	O
there	O
has	O
been	O
a	O
steady	B-METAPHOR
accumulation	O
of	O
evidence	O
that	O
personality	O
and	O
allied	O
affective	O
factors	O
play	B-METAPHOR
a	O
crucial	O
role	B-METAPHOR
in	O
determining	O
subject	B-METAPHOR
choice	O
and	O
student	O
success	O
.	O

Unfortunately	O
,	O
this	O
evidence	O
has	O
tended	O
to	O
be	O
fragmentary	O
,	O
a	O
collection	B-METAPHOR
of	O
separate	B-METAPHOR
,	O
discrete	O
pieces	B-METAPHOR
of	O
information	O
lacking	O
a	O
synthesizing	B-METAPHOR
theory	O
to	O
provide	O
cohesion	O
and	O
predictive	O
power	B-METAPHOR
.	O

The	O
few	O
models	B-METAPHOR
which	O
have	O
been	O
developed	O
to	O
date	O
may	O
have	O
been	O
correct	O
as	O
far	B-METAPHOR
as	O
they	O
go	B-METAPHOR
but	O
are	O
clearly	O
incomplete	O

,	O
Eiduson	O
(	O
1962	O
)	O
and	O
McClelland	O
(	O
1962	O
)	O
suggested	O
that	O
male	O
scientists	O
often	O
experienced	O
a	O
lonely	B-METAPHOR
childhood	O
,	O
perhaps	O
suffering	O
social	O
isolation	B-METAPHOR
through	O
illness	O
or	O
family	O
circumstances	O
,	O
so	O
that	O
they	O
developed	O
a	O
strong	B-METAPHOR
interest	O
in	O
their	O
surrounding	O
material	O
world	B-METAPHOR
and	O
a	O
below	O

interest	B-METAPHOR
in	O
other	O

Maslow	O
(	O
1966	O
)	O
and	O
Hudson	O
(	O
1966	O
and	O
1968	O
)	O
saw	B-METAPHOR
science	O
as	O
providing	O
an	O
emotionally	O
undemanding	B-METAPHOR
activity	O
appealing	B-METAPHOR
to	O
boys	O
moving	B-METAPHOR
from	O
the	O

the	O
turbulence	B-METAPHOR
of	O

Even	O
if	O
these	O
descriptions	O
are	O
valid	O
they	O
still	O
leave	B-METAPHOR
open	B-METAPHOR
a	O
number	O
of	O
questions	B-METAPHOR

why	O

from	O
our	O

at	O

a	O
model	B-METAPHOR
which	O
is	O

which	O

for	O
an	O
association	B-METAPHOR
between	O

We	O
need	O
now	O
only	O
take	B-METAPHOR
note	B-METAPHOR
of	O
the	O
most	O
salient	O
features	B-METAPHOR

The	O
most	O
obvious	O
one	O
is	O
that	O
of	O
sex	O

in	O
the	O
physical	O

engineering	O
,	O
throughout	O
the	O
Western	O
world	O
can	O
no	O
longer	O
be	O
satisfactorily	O
attributed	O
to	O
cognitive	O
differences	O
,	O
which	O
are	O
too	O
small	B-METAPHOR
,	O
nor	O
to	O
institutional	O
factors	O

Equal	O

in	O

and	O

has	O
not	O
made	B-METAPHOR

any	O
more	O
popular	O
with	O

Furthermore	O
,	O
the	O
characteristics	O
of	O
those	O
students	O
who	O
do	O
opt	O
for	O
science	O
show	B-METAPHOR
clear	B-METAPHOR
sex	O
differences	O

scientists	O
,	O
both	O
science	O
students	O

tend	O
to	O

These	O

can	O
be	O
seen	B-METAPHOR
quite	O
early	O
on	O

we	O
have	O
found	B-METAPHOR

In	O
this	O

demonstrates	B-METAPHOR
how	O
the	O

works	B-METAPHOR

by	O
appealing	B-METAPHOR

be	O

there	O

When	O

they	O
frequently	O
do	O
more	O
than	O

them	O
together	B-METAPHOR
with	O

A	O
common	O
result	O
of	O
this	O
is	O
that	O
when	O
the	O
philosophers	O
deny	O
autonomy	B-METAPHOR
to	O
women	O
,	O
they	O
do	O
so	O
for	O
the	O

sorts	O
of	O

that	O
they	O
deny	O
it	O
to	O
children	O

We	O
can	O
do	O
more	O
than	O
to	O
reject	O
such	O
descriptions	O
of	O
ourselves	O
;	O
we	O
can	O
ask	O
further	O
questions	O
:	O
are	O
children	O
like	O
this	O

this	O
why	O
children	O
are	O
not	O
autonomous	B-METAPHOR

Again	O

women	O
well	O
know	O
what	O
it	O
is	O

to	O
be	O
treated	O
as	O
children	O
and	O
they	O
find	B-METAPHOR
it	O
offensive	B-METAPHOR

It	O
would	O
therefore	O
be	O
reasonable	O
to	O
consider	B-METAPHOR
whether	O

We	O
must	O
remember	O
that	O
to	O
deny	O
someone	O
control	B-METAPHOR

to	O
offer	O
them	O
a	O

Perhaps	O
we	O
should	O
conduct	B-METAPHOR

many	O

observations	B-METAPHOR

putting	B-METAPHOR
them	O
right	O
without	O

no	O

Both	O

them	O
appear	O
to	O

from	O
a	O

myopia	B-METAPHOR

Harris	O
thinks	O
that	O

proposes	O
that	O

If	O
Holt	O
thinks	O
that	O
this	O
proposal	O
would	O
remove	B-METAPHOR
an	O
arbitrary	O
boundary	B-METAPHOR
line	B-METAPHOR
between	O
adults	O
and	O
children	O
,	O
then	O
he	O
is	O
mistaken	O
.	O

The	O
point	B-METAPHOR
about	O
an	O
adult	O
citizen	O
is	O
that	O
he	O
has	O
these	O
rights	O
,	O
privileges	O
,	O
duties	O
and	O
responsibilities	O
whether	O
or	O

he	O
wants	O
them	O

He	O
may	O
not	O
exercise	B-METAPHOR
his	O
rights	O
or	O
he	O
may	O
shirk	O
his	O
duties	O

he	O
can	O
not	O
forgo	O
them	O

They	O
are	O
not	O
just	O
available	O
to	O
him	O

they	O
are	O
his	O

That	O
is	O
what	O
being	O
a	O
citizen	O
involves	B-METAPHOR
.	O

Rights	O
and	O
privileges	O
do	O
not	O
pose	O
any	O
particular	O
problems	O
in	O
the	O
case	O
of	O
children	O
.	O

Holt	O
can	O
and	O
does	O
believe	O
that	O
children	O
should	O
have	O
them	O
as	O
adults	O
do	O
,	O
and	O
then	O
leaves	B-METAPHOR
it	O
up	O
to	O
the	O
child	O
to	O
decide	O
whether	O
or	O
not	O
to	O
exercise	B-METAPHOR
them	O
.	O

But	O
the	O
same	O
can	O
not	O
be	O
said	B-METAPHOR
for	O
duties	O
and	O
responsibilities	O
.	O

Failure	O
to	O
exercise	B-METAPHOR
one	O
's	O
rights	O
may	O
be	O
morally	O
neutral	O
;	O
failure	O
to	O
carry	O
out	O
one	O

duties	O
is	O
not	O

It	O
would	O
be	O
perfectly	O
possible	O
to	O
give	B-METAPHOR
the	O
rights	O
to	O
children	O
without	O
imposing	O
the	O
duties	O
on	O
them	O
,	O
the	O
one	O
does	O
not	O
entail	B-METAPHOR
the	O
other	O
,	O
but	O
we	O
would	O
then	O
still	O
be	O
distinguishing	B-METAPHOR
between	O

children	O
as	O
citizens	O

Children	O
still	O
would	O
not	O
have	O
full	B-METAPHOR

Duties	O

are	O
not	O

available	O
to	O

on	O

of	O
action	B-METAPHOR
,	O
have	O
a	O
word	O
with	O

You	O
mean	O
go	O
back	O
on	O
them	O
,	O
cos	O
we	O
did	O
n't	O
finish	O
them	O
cos	O
there	O

There	O
's	O
only	O
twelve	O
with	O

We	O
did	O
n't	O
finish	O
them	O
cos	O
they	O
wanted	O
to	O
start	O
trussing	O
early	O

It	O
's	O
what	O
you	O
had	O
last	O
week	O
.	O

and	O
then	O
Ann	O
started	O
that	O
little	O
line	B-METAPHOR
trussing	O
you	O
see	B-METAPHOR
,	O
so	O
we	O
've	O
done	O
it	O
between	O
us	O
but	O
I	O
've	O
got	B-METAPHOR
a	O
thousand	O
to	O
do	O
and	O
she	O
's	O
got	B-METAPHOR
about	O
four	O

Ann	O
,	O
even	O
if	O
they	O
do	O
some	O

I	O
bet	B-METAPHOR
you	O
feel	O
like	O
a	O
now	O
,	O
give	O
them	O
in	O
when	O
they	O
ca	O
n't	O
truss	O
them	O
du	O
n	O
no	O
.	O

That	O
I	O
've	O
only	O
had	O

We	O
give	O
them	O
in	O
when	O
they	O
came	B-METAPHOR
trussed	O
with	O
though	O
we	O
had	O
before	O
.	O

It	O
's	O
not	O
very	O
heavy	B-METAPHOR
Really	O
to	O
start	O
a	O

that	O
's	O

Well	O
,	O
with	O
the	O
two	O
lines	B-METAPHOR
going	B-METAPHOR
yeah	O
would	O
have	O
been	O
about	O
right	O
then	O
but	O
see	B-METAPHOR
,	O
John	O

do	O
n't	O

wished	O
I	O
'd	O
of	O
done	O
when	O
I	O
lost	B-METAPHOR
all	O
my	O
weight	O

And	O
we	O
're	O
gon	O
na	O
do	O
it	O
,	O
for	O
,	O
for	O
a	O

when	O
I	O
lost	B-METAPHOR
my	O
six	O
and	O
a	O
half	O

the	O
local	O
hospital	O
that	O
does	O
all	O
that	O

They	O
've	O
got	O
one	O
at	O
cos	O
I	O
mean	O
I	O
went	O

had	O
one	O
so	O
there	O
must	O
be	O
one	O
,	O
another	O
one	O

No	O
,	O
it	O
's	O
I	O
think	O
,	O

unless	O
it	O
for	O
,	O
it	O
must	O
be	O
for	O
Wisbech	O

It	O
might	O

Quite	O

and	O

Yeah	O
he	O
's	O
out	O
all	O
this	O
week	O
.	O

Well	O
,	O
my	O
dad	O
wo	O
n't	O
pass	B-METAPHOR
them	O
onto	O
Terry	O
.	O

Me	O
dad	O
said	O
he	O
's	O
had	O
enough	O
Well	O
,	O
we	O
were	O
debating	O
whether	O
to	O
give	B-METAPHOR
it	O
to	O
you	O
or	O
not	O
.	O

But	O
I	O
thought	O
,	O
well	O
if	O
Terry	O
notices	O
he	O
might	O
.	O

Well	O
in	O
fact	O
two	O
really	O
big	B-METAPHOR
estimates	O

Who	O
,	O
Terry	O
?	O

Yeah	O
.	O

And	O
one	O
wanted	B-METAPHOR
re-estimating	O
,	O
the	O
other	O
one	O
wanted	B-METAPHOR
a	O
few	O
more	O
prices	O
cos	O
everything	O
like	O
marble	O
tops	O
which	O
are	O
going	O
to	O
cost	O
a	O
fortune	O
to	O
get	O
done	O
.	O

We	O
give	B-METAPHOR
them	O
a	O
provisional	O
kind	O
of	O
price	O
and	O
not	O
really	O
gone	B-METAPHOR
into	O
it	O
in	O
detail	B-METAPHOR
.	O

So	O
she	O
had	O
a	O
list	O
of	O
about	O
five	O
things	B-METAPHOR
she	O
wanted	O
sorted	B-METAPHOR
out	O
and	O
she	O
said	O
so	O
far	B-METAPHOR
we	O
were	O
the	O
cheapest	O
.	O

But	O
she	O
's	O
got	B-METAPHOR
about	O
six	O
different	O
firms	O
on	O
the	O
computer	O
and	O
was	O
comparing	O
notes	O
.	O

So	O
I	O
worked	O
out	O
and	O
the	O
other	O
two	O
were	O
really	O
fitting	O
and	O
electrics	O
and	O
it	O
was	O
all	O
down	O
to	O
Terry	O
to	O
sort	B-METAPHOR
those	O
out	O
.	O

And	O
they	O
're	O
both	O
,	O
about	O
two	O
to	O
three	O
thousand	O
pounds	O
worth	O
of	O
sanitary	O
ware	O
or	O
more	O
but	O
two	O
to	O
three	O
thousand	O
pounds	O
worth	O
of	O
work	O
.	O

Well	O
you	O
ca	O
n't	O
afford	O
to	O
lose	B-METAPHOR
them	O
,	O
can	O
you	O
?	O

No	O
.	O

So	O
what	O
's	O
going	O
to	O
happen	O
then	O
?	O

God	O
knows	O
.	O

He	O
said	O
,	O
I	O
asked	O
,	O
asked	O
,	O
well	O
I	O
left	O
a	O
message	O
on	O
Saturday	O
for	O
him	O
to	O
sort	B-METAPHOR
them	O
out	O
did	O
n't	O
I	O
?	O

He	O
already	O
knew	O
about	O
that	O
.	O

And	O
then	O
I	O
asked	O
my	O
father	O
on	O
Tuesday	O
to	O
remind	O
him	O
and	O
he	O
said	O
,	O
he	O
'd	O
already	O
said	O
he	O
'd	O
fetch	B-METAPHOR
them	O
in	O
on	O
Tuesday	O
.	O

And	O
he	O
,	O
my	O
father	O
reminded	O
him	O
last	O
night	O
and	O
he	O
said	O
yeah	O
he	O
would	O
have	O
them	O
by	O
tomorrow	O
morning	O
.	O

But	O
he	O
's	O
,	O
he	O
just	O
really	O
has	O
to	O
get	O
in	O
touch	O
with	O
one	O
of	O
them	O
and	O
tell	O
them	O
the	O
prices	O
.	O

So	O
I	O
do	O
n't	O
know	O
.	O

Well	O
,	O
I	O
mean	O
he	O
'd	O
done	O
,	O
he	O
's	O
done	O
this	O
first	O
estimate	O
,	O
these	O
are	O
all	O
just	O
polishing	B-METAPHOR
touches	B-METAPHOR
cos	O
people	O
are	O
obviously	O
interested	O
in	O
,	O
you	O
know	O
they	O
're	O
well	O
keen	B-METAPHOR
on	O
our	O
prices	O
.	O

they	O
ca	O
n't	O
pursue	B-METAPHOR
it	O
till	O
we	O
come	O
back	O
to	O
them	O
.	O

They	O
're	O
not	O
pursuing	B-METAPHOR
it	O
until	O
we	O
put	B-METAPHOR
these	O
things	B-METAPHOR
out	O
.	O

My	O
father	O
just	O
turned	O
round	O
I	O
've	O
had	O
enough	O
of	O
it	O
if	O
Terry	O
's	O
not	O
going	O
to	O
do	O
the	O
estimate	O
he	O
passes	B-METAPHOR
them	O
on	O
to	O
Brian	O
.	O

I	O
said	O
yeah	O
then	O
I	O
get	B-METAPHOR
into	O
trouble	O
with	O
them	O
for	O
not	O
passing	B-METAPHOR
estimates	O
to	O
Terry	O
and	O
then	O
there	O
's	O
an	O
argument	O
.	O

If	O
he	O
,	O
if	O
he	O
says	O
anything	O
to	O
me	O
I	O
'll	O
just	O
have	O
to	O
tell	O
him	O
.	O

But	O
he	O
's	O
not	O
doing	O
the	O
estimates	O
he	O
's	O
been	O
given	B-METAPHOR
and	O
he	O
ca	O
n't	O
afford	O
to	O
throw	B-METAPHOR
money	O
away	B-METAPHOR
.	O

It	O
's	O
cos	O
he	O
's	O
working	O
for	O
him	O
at	O
the	O
moment	O
money	O
.	O

He	O
always	O
gets	O
like	O
that	O
and	O
then	O
he	O
forgets	O
after	O
like	O
a	O
month	O
or	O
two	O
when	O
he	O
has	O
n't	O
worked	O
for	O
him	O
.	O

He	O
forgets	O
how	O
annoying	O
he	O
can	O
be	O
and	O
you	O
know	O
he	O
swings	B-METAPHOR
the	O
other	O
way	B-METAPHOR
.	O

I	O
mean	O
Brian	O
's	O
pulled	O
in	O
a	O
lot	B-METAPHOR
of	O
work	O
.	O

lot	B-METAPHOR
of	O
people	O
kind	O
of	O
saying	O
come	O
back	O
again	O
on	O
Thursday	O
So	O
he	O
's	O
,	O
he	O
's	O
.	O

If	O
we	O
got	B-METAPHOR
Terry	O
to	O
do	O
that	O
we	O
'd	O
be	O
well	O
away	B-METAPHOR
.	O

They	O
,	O
they	O
would	O
love	O
him	O
I	O
mean	O
one	O
of	O
them	O
it	O
was	O
annoying	O
really	O
cos	O
Terry	O
's	O
just	O
not	O
pulling	B-METAPHOR
his	O
weight	B-METAPHOR
.	O

I	O
do	O
n't	O
understand	O
it	O
,	O
if	O
I	O
live	O
to	O
be	O
a	O
hundred	O
I	O
wo	O
n't	O
understand	O
it	O
.	O

And	O
also	O
,	O
it	O
's	O
cos	O
that	O
,	O
you	O
know	O
after	O
we	O
had	O
